Your experience at NovaTech has likely given you a deep understanding of the company's technology stack and the challenges that come with it.\n\nNow, let's dive into the plan for rolling out New Relic to your team. With your background in backend development, you'll be able to provide valuable insights into the implementation process and ensure a smooth integration with your existing workflows.\n\nRemember to start small, focusing on a pilot group or a single application to test the implementation and work out any kinks. This will help you refine your approach before scaling up to the rest of the team.\n\nAs you begin the rollout, be sure to communicate clearly with your team, providing regular updates, training, and feedback sessions. This will help ensure a smooth transition and get everyone on board with using New Relic.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance on the rollout process. I'm here to help you succeed!",
