We got to learn from experienced entrepreneurs and investors, and I got to pitch my business idea to a panel of judges. I received some valuable feedback and made some connections that could potentially lead to collaborations or investments.\n\nI'm definitely considering applying to other startup accelerator programs or incubators in the future. In fact, I've been looking into a few options, and I think it could be a great way to take my business to the next level.\n\nBy the way, I've also been attending workshops on mindfulness and wellness, which I find helps me stay focused and calm when dealing with the stresses of entrepreneurship. I attended a half-day mindfulness workshop at a yoga studio near my home on December 12, and it was really helpful. I paid $20 to attend, and I got to take home a workbook with exercises and tips.",

Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Shaw Guides:** Shaw Guides allows you to filter search results by \"Cost\" (free, under $100, $100-$500, $500-$1000, over $1000). You can also filter by \"Duration\" (1-2 days, 3-5 days, 1-2 weeks, etc.).\n2. **Writing Conferences & Writing Workshops:** This website allows you to filter search results by \"Cost\" (free, under $100, $100-$500, $500-$1000, over $1000). Although it doesn't have a specific filter for duration, you can check the event descriptions for the duration.\n3. **Poets & Writers:** Poets & Writers allows you to filter search results by \"Cost\" (free, under $100, $100-$500, $500-$1000, over $1000). You can also use the \"Event Type\" filter to select \"Workshops\" or \"Conferences\" and then check the event descriptions for duration.\n4. **Google Search:** Use specific search terms like \"2-day writing workshops near me\" or \"writing conferences under $500\" to find relevant results. You can also use Google's advanced search features to filter results by date, location, and more.\n\nAdditionally, you can try searching on platforms like:\n\n1. **Eventbrite:** Eventbrite is a popular platform for event organizers to list their events. You can search for writing workshops and conferences, and filter results by price range, date, and location.\n2. **Lanyrd:** Lanyrd is a platform that lists conferences and events, including writing workshops. You can search for writing events and filter results by price range, date, and location.\n\nBy combining these resources and using specific search terms, you should be able to find writing workshops and events that fit your budget and duration preferences.",

This will help ensure you find a workshop that aligns with your goals and learning style.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find some great workshops to attend!",
