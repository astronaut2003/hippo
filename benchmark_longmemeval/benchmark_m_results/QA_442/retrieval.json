Here's a suggested format:\n\n**Star Wars Marathon**\n\n1. Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n2. Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n3. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n4.

      "memory": "Brooklyn Nine-Nine is an amazing show that's sure to lift your mood and provide plenty of laughs.\n\nAs for finishing a season in a week, it's definitely doable, but it depends on your viewing schedule and pace. Brooklyn Nine-Nine has 8 seasons, with around 22-24 episodes per season. Each episode is approximately 22 minutes long, so it's a relatively quick watch.\n\nIf you aim to watch 3-4 episodes per day, you can easily finish a season in a week. However, if you're a binge-watcher, you might find yourself devouring an entire season in a few days!\n\nHere's a rough guide to help you plan your viewing schedule:\n\n* 3 episodes per day: 7-10 days to finish a season\n* 4 episodes per day: 5-7 days to finish a season\n* 5 episodes per day: 4-5 days to finish a season\n\nRemember, it's essential to pace yourself and take breaks to avoid burnout. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a show that's meant to be enjoyed, so don't rush through it!\n\nIf you need any more recommendations or have questions about the show, feel free to ask. Otherwise, grab some snacks, get cozy, and get ready to laugh your way through Brooklyn Nine-Nine!",

      "memory": "Both God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn are indeed lengthy games, but they're worth the investment. Here's a rough estimate of the time it takes to complete the main story for each game:\n\n**God of War (2018)**:\n\n* Main story: 15-20 hours\n* Main story with some side quests: 25-30 hours\n* 100% completion: 40-50 hours\n\nThe game's main story is well-paced, and you can complete it in around 15-20 hours. However, if you want to explore the world, complete side quests, and upgrade Kratos' gear, you'll need to add another 10-20 hours to your playtime.\n\n**Horizon Zero Dawn**:\n\n* Main story: 20-25 hours\n* Main story with some side quests: 30-35 hours\n* 100% completion: 50-60 hours\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn's main story is a bit longer than God of War's, but it's still manageable. You can complete the main story in around 20-25 hours, and adding side quests will take you up to 30-35 hours. If you want to explore the entire world, complete all side quests, and max out Aloy's skills, you'll need to invest around 50-60 hours.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates can vary depending on your playstyle and difficulty level. If you're not sure about committing to such long games, you could try playing the first few hours of each game to get a feel for the gameplay, story, and world.\n\nIf you're short on time, you could also consider playing the games in smaller chunks, focusing on completing the main story and then returning to the game later to explore the side content. Both games have a strong narrative focus, so you can still enjoy the story even if you don't complete every side quest or collectible.",
