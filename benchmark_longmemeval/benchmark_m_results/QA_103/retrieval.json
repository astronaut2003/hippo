He's known for being a down-to-earth and humble guy, so it's great to hear that he was nice and accommodating. Getting a picture with him must have been a fantastic way to cap off an already incredible evening.\n\nRed Rocks is indeed an iconic venue, and being close to the stage must have added to the overall energy and excitement of the concert. The scenery surrounding the venue is simply breathtaking, with the red rock formations and the stunning views of the Rocky Mountains. It's no wonder it's considered one of the best outdoor music venues in the world.\n\nIt's great that you and Jake had such an amazing time at the concert and got to experience some special moments together. Those are the kinds of memories that last a lifetime, and it's wonderful that you have a cool story to share about meeting Brandon Flowers.\n\nNow, go enjoy exploring the music of those new bands I recommended, and I hope you discover some new favorite artists!",
