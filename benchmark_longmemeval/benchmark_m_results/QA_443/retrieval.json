Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Past sales data:** How many candles and soaps did you sell at the smaller market on August 15th, where you tested your pumpkin spice candle recipe? This will give us a baseline for demand.\n2. **Average sale per customer:** Approximately how many items do customers typically buy from you at a market? This will help us estimate the total number of items you'll need.\n3. **Market size and duration:** How many attendees are expected at the Harvest Market, and how many days will it run? This will impact the total demand.\n4. **Competition:** Are there other vendors selling similar products at the market? If so, this might affect your sales.\n\nOnce we have these numbers, we can make some calculations to estimate your inventory needs.\n\nAssuming you want to make sure you don't run out too quickly, we can aim to stock a bit extra. A general rule of thumb is to increase your inventory by 10-20% to account for unexpected demand.\n\nLet's get started! Please provide the necessary information, and I'll help you calculate your inventory needs for the Harvest Market.",

      "memory": "**Fertilizing during summer months:**\n\nFertilizing your plants during the summer months can be beneficial, but it's essential to do it correctly to avoid over-fertilizing. Here are some tips:\n\n1. **Dilute the fertilizer**: During the summer, plants are actively growing, and their roots are more susceptible to burning from excessive fertilizer. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to prevent damage.\n2. **Fertilize less frequently**: You can reduce the frequency of fertilizing to every 2-3 weeks, depending on the type of fertilizer and your plant's growth rate.\n3. **Choose a balanced fertilizer**: Use a balanced fertilizer with an equal N-P-K ratio (e.g., 20-20-20) to provide your plants with the necessary nutrients for healthy growth.\n4. **Monitor your plant's response**: Keep an eye on your plant's response to fertilizing. If you notice any signs of over-fertilization (e.g., yellowing leaves, crispy tips), reduce the frequency or strength of the fertilizer.\n\n**Your prayer plant's fertilizing schedule:**\n\nFertilizing your prayer plant once a week might be too frequent, especially during the summer. Consider reducing the frequency to every 2-3 weeks, and dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength.\n\n**Congratulations on repotting your fiddle leaf fig tree!**\n\nIt's great to hear that your fiddle leaf fig tree is looking healthier after repotting! Three weeks is a good amount of time for the plant to adjust to its new pot and soil. Here are some additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Monitor watering**: Fiddle leaf fig trees prefer well-draining soil and can be prone to root rot if the soil is too wet. Make sure to check the soil moisture regularly and avoid overwatering.\n2. **Provide sufficient light**: Fiddle leaf fig trees prefer bright, indirect light. If possible, move the plant to a spot with more light or consider using grow lights.\n3. **Maintain humidity**: Fiddle leaf fig trees prefer a humid environment, typically above 50%. You can use a humidifier or group plants together to create a microclimate.\n\n**Additional tips for summer plant care:**\n\n1. **Prune plants regularly**: Prune your plants to maintain their shape, promote healthy growth, and encourage blooming.\n2. **Watch for pests**: Summer is a prime time for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and scale to appear. Monitor your plants regularly and take action if you notice any infestations.\n3. **Provide support**: If your plants are top-heavy or prone to flopping, provide support with stakes or trellises to keep them upright and promote healthy growth.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",

It's an excellent way to stay on top of your plant care routine.\n\nSince you're already using a mixture of water and fertilizer, you can adjust the watering frequency based on the fertilizer's instructions and your peace lily's response. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* **Watering frequency:** Water your peace lily when the top 1-2 inches of the soil feel dry to the touch. This is usually every 7-10 days during the spring and summer months when the plant is actively growing. During the fall and winter, you can reduce watering to every 10-14 days, as the plant grows slower.\n* **Fertilizer frequency:** Since you're using a fertilizer mixture, you can follow the instructions on the label for application frequency. Typically, you'll want to fertilize your peace lily every 1-2 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) and reduce frequency to once a month during the dormant season (fall and winter).\n* **Soil moisture:** Make sure to check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. If it's already moist, wait a few more days before watering again.\n* **Adjust according to climate:** If you live in a hot and dry climate, you may need to water your peace lily more frequently. Conversely, if you live in a cool and humid climate, you may be able to get away with watering less often.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Don't overwater:** Peace lilies are prone to root rot if the soil is too moist. Make sure to avoid getting water on the crown (where the leaves meet the stem) and avoid letting the pot sit in water.\n* **Monitor the plant:** Keep an eye on your peace lily's leaves and stems. If they start to droop or turn yellow, it may be a sign that the plant is getting too much or too little water.\n* **Adjust as needed:** Be prepared to adjust your watering schedule based on your peace lily's response. If you notice the plant is consistently drying out too quickly or staying too wet, adjust the frequency and amount of water accordingly.\n\nBy following these guidelines and monitoring your peace lily's response, you should be able to find the perfect balance for your plant. Happy planting!",
