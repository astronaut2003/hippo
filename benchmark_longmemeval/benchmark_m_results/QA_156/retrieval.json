Simmer until the veggies are tender, then season with Italian herbs and a squeeze of lemon juice.\n\n**2. Black Bean and Sweet Potato Soup**\n\nThis flavorful soup is a twist on traditional black bean soup. Roast diced sweet potatoes and onions in the oven until tender, then blend with cooked black beans, diced tomatoes, and vegetable broth. Add a sprinkle of cumin and chili powder for a boost of flavor.\n\n**3. Butternut Squash and Chickpea Curry Soup**\n\nThis creamy soup is a perfect blend of fall flavors. Roast diced butternut squash and onions, then blend with cooked chickpeas, coconut milk, and a mixture of Indian spices like cumin, coriander, and turmeric.

Creamy Broccoli and Potato Soup**\n\nThis comforting soup is a great way to get your daily dose of greens. Blend cooked broccoli, diced potatoes, garlic, and onions with chicken or vegetable broth, then stir in some heavy cream or Greek yogurt for a rich and creamy texture.\n\n**6. White Bean and Kale Soup**\n\nThis Italian-inspired soup is a great way to warm up on a chilly day. Saute onions, garlic, and carrots, then add canned cannellini beans, chopped kale, and vegetable broth. Simmer until the kale is tender, then season with lemon juice and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.\n\n**7. Chicken and Rice Soup**\n\nThis classic comfort food is easy to make in large batches.

Congratulations on reducing food waste and getting creative with your leftovers.\n\nI'd be happy to help you with some new recipe ideas to use up leftover vegetables. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Veggie Frittata**: Whisk together eggs, salt, and pepper, then add diced leftover veggies (like bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and spinach) to the mixture. Pour into a greased skillet and cook until the eggs are set.\n2. **Soup or Stew**: Use leftover veggies to make a hearty soup or stew. You can puree them with some broth and cream for a creamy soup, or add them to a simmering pot of stew with some beans and grains.\n3. **Roasted Veggie Wrap**: Toss leftover veggies (like broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots) with olive oil, salt, and your favorite spices. Roast in the oven until tender, then wrap them in a whole grain tortilla with hummus or tzatziki sauce.\n4. **Veggie Burgers**: Mash cooked veggies (like sweet potatoes, black beans, and mushrooms) with some breadcrumbs and spices. Form into patties and grill or pan-fry until crispy. Serve on a bun with your favorite toppings.\n5. **Quiche or Tart**: Similar to a frittata, but with a pastry crust. Use leftover veggies like zucchini, eggplant, and cherry tomatoes, and add some cheese and herbs for flavor.\n6. **Stir-Fry**: Sauté leftover veggies (like bell peppers, onions, and snow peas) with some oil, garlic, and ginger. Serve over rice, noodles, or as a filling for wraps or tacos.\n7. **Grilled Veggie Salad**: Toss leftover veggies (like asparagus, zucchini, and red onion) with olive oil, lemon juice, and your favorite herbs. Grill until tender, then top a bed of greens with the veggies and add a protein source like grilled chicken or tofu.\n8. **Veggie Cakes**: Similar to veggie burgers, but shape into patties and coat with breadcrumbs. Pan-fry until crispy and serve with a side of tartar sauce or remoulade.\n9. **Freeze It**: If you can't use up all your leftover veggies before they go bad, consider freezing them for later use. Chopped veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots freeze well and can be added to soups, stews, or stir-fries later.\n10. **Veggie Broth**: Use leftover veggies to make a delicious and nutritious broth. Simply simmer them in water with some aromatics like onion, garlic, and celery, then strain and use as a base for soups or stews.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create something delicious with your leftover veggies!\n\nWhat's your favorite way to use up leftover vegetables? Do you have any specific veggies you're trying to use up right now?",
