Here are some tips to help you review and capture all the contacts from the 7 events:\n\n**Reviewing Notes:**\n\n1. **Go through your event notes**: Gather all your notes from the 7 events, whether they're handwritten, typed, or recorded. Review each note, and extract the names, contact information, and any relevant details about the conversations you had.\n2. **Look for mentions of people**: Scan your notes for mentions of people you met, even if they didn't give you a business card. You might have jotted down their name, company, or a brief description of your conversation.\n3. **Check for action items**: Identify any action items or follow-ups you noted during the events. This will help you remember specific conversations and ensure you don't miss anyone.\n\n**Organizing Business Cards:**\n\n1. **Gather all business cards**: Collect all the business cards you received during the 7 events. Sort them by event or date to make it easier to review.\n2. **Create a business card spreadsheet**: Consider creating a separate spreadsheet or table to organize your business cards. Columns can include:\n\t* Name\n\t* Company\n\t* Title\n\t* Email\n\t* Phone\n\t* Event\n\t* Notes (any additional information about the conversation)\n3. **Transcribe relevant information**: Transcribe the relevant information from each business card into your spreadsheet. You can also take a photo of each card and attach it to the corresponding row in your spreadsheet.\n4. **Match business cards with notes**: Cross-reference your business cards with your event notes to ensure you haven't missed anyone. If you have notes about a conversation, but no business card, try to find the person's contact information online or through LinkedIn.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Check your email**: Review your email inbox and sent folder for any emails you exchanged with contacts from the events.\n2. **Scan event attendee lists**: If you have access to the event attendee lists, review them to see if you missed anyone.\n3. **Ask colleagues or friends**: If you attended events with colleagues or friends, ask them if they remember anyone you might have forgotten.\n4. **Set a deadline**: Give yourself a deadline to review all your notes and business cards, and aim to enter the information into your spreadsheet within a certain timeframe (e.g., a week).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to capture most of the contacts from the 7 events. Remember to be thorough, and don't hesitate to reach out to people you're unsure about. Good luck, and happy organizing!",
