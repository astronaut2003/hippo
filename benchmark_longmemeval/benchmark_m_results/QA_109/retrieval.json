Netflix doesn't provide a direct way to track screen time, but I can offer a few workarounds:\n\n**Method 1: Netflix Viewing History**\n\n1. Sign in to your Netflix account on a web browser.\n2. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner, then select \"Account.\"\n3. Scroll down to the \"Settings\" section and click on \"Viewing activity.\"\n4. You'll see a list of everything you've watched, including the date and time. You can use this to estimate your screen time.\n\n**Method 2: Third-Party Browser Extensions**\n\n1. Install a browser extension like **Netflix Tracker** (Chrome) or **Netflix Watch History** (Firefox).\n2. These extensions will track your Netflix viewing history, including the time spent watching.\n3. Note that these extensions might not be 100% accurate, as they rely on your browser's history.\n\n**Method 3: Mobile Apps**\n\n1. If you watch Netflix on your mobile device, you can use apps like **Screen Time** (iOS) or **Digital Wellbeing** (Android) to track your screen time.\n2. These apps can provide a more accurate picture of your overall screen time, including Netflix usage.\n\n**Method 4: Manual Tracking**\n\n1. Keep a log or spreadsheet to manually track your Netflix screen time.\n2. Each time you finish watching a documentary or show, note down the time spent watching.\n3. This method requires discipline, but it's a simple way to keep track of your screen time.\n\nTo estimate your screen time for last month, you can try Method 1 or Method 2. If you're concerned about your screen time in general, Method 3 or Method 4 might be a better fit.\n\nNow, back to machine learning! What specific tasks or predictions do you want to automate or make with machine learning in your work projects?",

From the dropdown menu, select \"Account\" and then \"Profile\" or \"Settings.\" Scroll down to the \"My Profile\" section, and you should see a \"Viewing activity\" or \"Watch history\" option.\n3. **Netflix App Settings**: On the Netflix app, go to the \"More\" or \"Hamburger\" menu (three horizontal lines or a circle with three lines) and select \"App Settings.\" Scroll down to the \"Account\" or \"Profile\" section, and look for the \"Viewing activity\" or \"Watch history\" option.\n\nOnce you access your viewing history, you should be able to see how many seasons of Schitt's Creek you've watched.
