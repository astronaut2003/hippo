Regularly reviewing and updating your spreadsheet is crucial to ensure it remains a valuable tool for your couponing journey. Here's a suggested schedule to help you stay on top of your coupons:\n\n1. **Weekly review**: Set aside 10-15 minutes each week (e.g., Sunday evening or Monday morning) to:\n\t* Review expiring coupons and plan your shopping trip accordingly.\n\t* Add new coupons you've found or received.\n\t* Remove expired or used coupons.\n\t* Update your dashboard or summary sheet (if you have one).\n2. **Bi-weekly or monthly deep dive**: Schedule a deeper review every 2-4 weeks to:\n\t* Organize and categorize your coupons more thoroughly.\n\t* Check for duplicate coupons or errors.\n\t* Update your coupon sources or remove inactive ones.\n\t* Reflect on your couponing strategy and adjust as needed.\n3. **Quarterly cleanup**: Set aside 30 minutes to an hour every 3-4 months to:\n\t* Purge expired or unused coupons.\n\t* Reorganize your spreadsheet structure or categories as needed.\n\t* Review your couponing goals and adjust your strategy for the upcoming quarter.\n\nRemember, the frequency of your reviews will depend on your personal preferences and couponing habits. If you're an avid couponer, you might need to review your spreadsheet more frequently. If you're just starting out, you might prefer a less frequent schedule.\n\nBy regularly reviewing and updating your spreadsheet, you'll ensure you're always using the most relevant and valuable coupons, and you'll stay organized and focused on your couponing goals.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any more questions or need further guidance. Happy spreadsheeting!",
