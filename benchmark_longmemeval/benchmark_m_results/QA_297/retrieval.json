While I don't have specific information about the Modern Art Museum's collection, I can suggest some general tips to help you make the most of your visit:\n\n1. Check the museum's website: Before your visit, browse the museum's website to get an overview of their permanent collection. Look for online catalogs, collection highlights, or featured artworks to get a sense of what's on display.\n2. Ask museum staff: When you arrive at the museum, ask staff or volunteers about notable pieces or must-see artworks in the permanent collection. They often have valuable insights and can provide recommendations.\n3. Look for interactive resources: Many museums offer interactive kiosks, mobile apps, or audio guides that provide additional information about the artworks on display. Take advantage of these resources to deepen your understanding of the collection.\n4. Take a self-guided tour: If you can't find a guided tour that fits your schedule, consider taking a self-guided tour. Most museums provide maps or brochures that highlight key artworks and exhibitions. You can also create your own tour by focusing on specific artists, styles, or themes that interest you.\n\nRegarding guided tours, I recommend checking the museum's website or contacting them directly to inquire about available tours and programs. They may offer daily or weekly tours, as well as special programs or events that provide in-depth exploration of specific aspects of the collection.\n\nWhile Dr. Patel's tour was undoubtedly enlightening, it's possible that the museum offers other tours or programs led by knowledgeable guides or experts in the field. Keep an open mind and be willing to explore different perspectives and insights – you might discover new favorite artists or artworks!\n\nRemember to take your time, enjoy the art, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance from museum staff. Happy museum-going!",
