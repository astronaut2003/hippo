The wizard is willing to pay a good sum of gold for the recovery of these books, as they are said to contain powerful and dangerous magic.\n\nAct 1: The Journey to the Estate\nThe players will begin their journey to the ruined estate, which is located several miles outside of the nearest town. During their journey, they will encounter several obstacles, including treacherous terrain, wild beasts, and bandit attacks. The players may also come across other travelers who could provide them with valuable information about the estate and the Red Wizard.\n\nAct 2: Exploring the Estate\nOnce the players arrive at the estate, they will find that it is a large, sprawling mansion that has been mostly destroyed by time and the elements. The mansion is filled with danger, as it is home to various traps, puzzles, and hostile creatures. The players will need to explore the mansion and its many rooms, fighting off any threats and solving puzzles in order to find the spellbooks.\n\nOne of the challenges that the players will face is navigating the complex and maze-like interior of the mansion. The mansion is filled with secret passages, false walls, and hidden rooms, making it difficult for the players to know where they are going.\n\nAct 3: The Red Wizard's Study\nOnce the players have explored enough of the mansion, they will eventually come across the Red Wizard's study, where they will find the spellbooks. However, the study is guarded by a powerful magic trap that will need to be disarmed before the players can access the books.\n\nThe study is also home to the Red Wizard's ghost, who will challenge the players to a final battle. The ghost is a formidable opponent, and the players will need to use all of their skills and spells in order to defeat him.\n\nConclusion:\nIf the players are successful in defeating the ghost and retrieving the spellbooks, they can return to the wizard who hired them and collect their reward. The wizard will be pleased to have the books in his possession, but warns the players that the magic contained within them is dangerous and should not be used lightly.\n\nThis adventure is designed for four 2nd-level players, but can be adjusted to accommodate a different number of players or different levels of difficulty.",
