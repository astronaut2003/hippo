      "memory": "That's great that you've found a way to make the most of your daily commute!\n\nThe audiobook version of \"All the Light We Cannot See\" is approximately 16 hours and 2 minutes long. Assuming you listen to it during your daily commute, let's estimate the number of days it would take to finish the book.\n\nIf you listen to the audiobook for about 30-45 minutes per day (a rough estimate for a daily commute), you can expect to finish the book in around 35-45 days. This is roughly 5-6 weeks, which is a bit longer than the three weeks it took you to finish \"The Nightingale\".\n\nHowever, there are a few factors to consider:\n\n1. **Your listening speed**: If you prefer a faster listening speed, you can adjust the audiobook's playback speed to 1.25x or 1.5x, which would reduce the overall listening time.\n2. **Your commute duration**: If your commute is longer or shorter, this will impact the number of days it takes to finish the book.\n3. **Your listening frequency**: If you listen to the audiobook during your daily commute, but also listen to it during other times of the day (e.g., while exercising or doing chores), you'll finish the book faster.\n\nTo give you a better estimate, here's a rough breakdown of the listening time per day:\n\n* 30 minutes/day: 45-50 days to finish\n* 45 minutes/day: 35-40 days to finish\n* 1 hour/day: 25-30 days to finish\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and your actual listening time may vary. Nevertheless, with a consistent daily commute and listening schedule, you should be able to finish \"All the Light We Cannot See\" within 5-7 weeks.\n\nEnjoy your audiobook journey!",
