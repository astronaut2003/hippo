      "memory": "Watercolor painting is a wonderful medium! You can definitely learn watercolor painting through online tutorials and classes, but I think a combination of both online and in-person learning would be ideal. Here's why:\n\n**Online tutorials and classes:**\n\n1. **Convenience**: Online tutorials and classes offer flexibility and convenience. You can learn at your own pace, anytime, and from the comfort of your own home.\n2. **Access to a wide range of resources**: Online platforms provide access to a vast array of tutorials, classes, and instructors. You can explore different styles, techniques, and approaches to watercolor painting.\n3. **Cost-effective**: Online classes and tutorials are often more affordable than in-person classes, which can be a significant cost savings.\n4. **Review and replay**: With online tutorials, you can review and replay lessons as many times as you need to, which is helpful when learning new techniques.\n\n**In-person classes:**\n\n1. **Hands-on guidance**: In-person classes provide hands-on guidance and feedback from an experienced instructor. They can correct any mistakes, offer personalized tips, and help you improve your technique.\n2. **Immediate feedback**: You'll receive immediate feedback on your work, which can help you identify areas for improvement and adjust your technique accordingly.\n3. **Social learning**: In-person classes offer a social learning environment where you can connect with other students, share ideas, and learn from each other's experiences.\n4. **Tactile experience**: Watercolor painting involves working with physical materials, and in-person classes allow you to experience the texture, feel, and behavior of watercolors firsthand.\n\n**Combining online and in-person learning:**\n\n1. **Foundational knowledge**: Start with online tutorials and classes to learn the basics of watercolor painting, such as color theory, brushstrokes, and techniques.\n2. **In-person refinement**: Once you have a solid foundation, take an in-person class to refine your skills, get personalized feedback, and work on more complex projects.\n3. **Practice and reinforcement**: Continue practicing and reinforcing your skills through online tutorials and classes, using the techniques and feedback you received in the in-person class.\n\nTo get started, you could begin with online tutorials and classes to learn the basics of watercolor painting. Some popular online resources include:\n\n* **Watercolor University**: A comprehensive online course platform dedicated to watercolor painting.\n* **The Art of Watercolor**: A website offering online classes, tutorials, and resources for watercolor artists.\n* **Skillshare**: A online learning platform that offers a variety of watercolor painting classes and workshops.\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with the basics, consider taking an in-person class to further develop your skills.
