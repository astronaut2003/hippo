This can lead to anxiety, regret, and difficulty finding meaning in life experiences.\n\nWorkers can play a vital role in supporting elderly individuals to reflect on their past and present, find peace with regrets, and deepen relationships with loved ones through open and honest communication. Encouraging elderly individuals to make decisions about their end-of-life wishes can also help them approach death positively and with dignity.\n\nBy providing the tools for control and closure, workers can empower elderly individuals to live out their remaining years with fulfillment, purpose, and without regret.",
