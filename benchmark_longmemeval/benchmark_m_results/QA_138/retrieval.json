While it's not as humorous as \"My Favorite Murder,\" it's also not as dry or sensational as some other serious true crime podcasts.\n\nThe tone of \"Criminal\" is more thoughtful, introspective, and nuanced. Host Phoebe Judge has a calm and empathetic approach, which creates a sense of intimacy and vulnerability. The podcast often focuses on the human side of the story, exploring the complexities and emotions involved in each case.\n\nPhoebe's storytelling style is engaging, and she has a way of making you feel like you're having a conversation with her. She's not afraid to ask tough questions, but she's also not sensational or lurid in her approach. The podcast often touches on themes like morality, justice, and the human condition, which adds depth to the storytelling.\n\nThat being said, \"Criminal\" is still a true crime podcast, and it can be intense and disturbing at times. However, the tone is more measured and thoughtful, which makes it feel less exploitative than some other true crime podcasts.\n\nIf you're looking for a true crime podcast that's more serious and in-depth than \"My Favorite Murder\" but still engaging and well-produced, \"Criminal\" is definitely worth checking out.",
