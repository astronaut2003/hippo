This progression is a common one in jazz and creates a sense of tension and release that can complement the emotional intensity of the original song.\n\nFor example, using the key of C Major, the chords would be Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7. This progression creates a sense of tension with the Dm7 and G7 chords, which resolves to the Cmaj7 chord, providing a sense of resolution.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a ii-V-vi-iii-vi-ii-V-I progression. This progression is similar to ii-V-I but adds more tension and release, and creates a more dynamic and harmonically interesting background for the vocals.\n\nYou could also experiment with different chord inversions, chord substitutions and even add some dissonant chords to create a more unique and interesting harmonic background.",
