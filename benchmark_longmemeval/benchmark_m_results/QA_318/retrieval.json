Ask a virtual assistant: If you have a virtual assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can ask them \"What day is it today?\"\n3. Look out the window: If you can see the sun or the sky, you can take a guess based on the time of day and the lighting.\n\nOnce you know the day of the week, you can start planning your to-do list and scheduling your tasks for the next few days.

Since you're already familiar with this schedule, it'll be easier to get back into the routine.\n\nTo make it even more effective, you could try to create a Sunday evening ritual around your video calls. For example:\n\n* Set a reminder on your phone to ensure you don't forget the call.\n* Prepare a favorite snack or drink to enjoy during the call.\n* Find a comfortable and quiet spot to sit and chat.\n* Take a few minutes before the call to collect your thoughts and reflect on your week.\n* Make a note of any topics you want to discuss or ask your friends about.\n\nBy doing so, you'll create a sense of consistency and make the experience feel more enjoyable and relaxing.\n\nNow that you have a plan in place, here's a suggestion:\n\n**Send out a group message to your friends**: Let them know that you'd like to start scheduling regular video calls again, and propose the Sunday evening time slot. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey friends! I've been thinking, and I'd love to start our regular video calls again. How about we schedule them for Sunday evenings, every other week? It'll be great to catch up and chat about our lives. Let me know if this time works for you, and we can start again soon!\"\n\nThis will help get everyone on the same page and excited about reconnecting.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to reach out to your friends and get started?",
