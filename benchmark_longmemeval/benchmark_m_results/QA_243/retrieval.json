      "memory": "What a wonderful way to spend your birthday! Oahu has many beautiful beaches, and I'd be happy to recommend some less crowded options. Here are a few:\n\n**Kaimana Beach**: Located in the Kahala neighborhood, Kaimana Beach is a local favorite that's often less crowded than Waikiki. It's a picturesque beach with calm waters, perfect for swimming and snorkeling.\n\n**Kailua Beach**: On the windward coast, Kailua Beach is a serene and tranquil spot with soft white sand and crystal-clear waters. It's a bit of a drive from Honolulu, but worth it for the peace and quiet.\n\n**Lanikai Beach**: Another windward coast gem, Lanikai Beach is a secluded spot with turquoise waters and powdery white sand. It's a bit of a hike to get there, but the scenery and tranquility make it well worth the effort.\n\n**Shark's Cove**: Yes, I know I mentioned Shark's Cove earlier for snorkeling, but it's also a great spot for relaxing on the beach. The cove is protected, making the waters calm and perfect for swimming. Plus, the scenery is stunning!\n\n**Waialae Beach**: Located in the East Oahu neighborhood of Hawaii Kai, Waialae Beach is a quiet spot with calm waters and a picturesque view of the Ko'olau Mountains.\n\nThese beaches are all less crowded than Waikiki, but still offer plenty of amenities like parking, restrooms, and food vendors. Just remember to always respect the local environment and community, and take all your trash with you when you leave.\n\nIf you're looking for an even more secluded spot, consider visiting during the week or early morning/late afternoon when the crowds are smaller. Whichever beach you choose, I hope you have a wonderful and relaxing birthday!",
