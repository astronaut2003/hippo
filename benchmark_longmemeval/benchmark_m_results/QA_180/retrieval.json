Here are some examples of goals you could set for each class:\n\n**Zumba Classes (Tuesdays and Thursdays):**\n\n1. **Master a new step or routine**: Identify a specific step or routine that challenges you and make it your goal to master it by the end of the month.\n2. **Increase endurance**: Aim to complete a certain number of songs or minutes without taking a break, and gradually increase the duration over time.\n3. **Improve your technique**: Focus on perfecting your arm movements, hip swivels, or footwork, and ask Maria for feedback on your progress.\n4. **Burn a certain number of calories**: Use a heart rate monitor or fitness tracker to track your calorie burn and aim to increase it over time.\n\n**Weightlifting Class (Saturdays):**\n\n1. **Increase weight or reps**: Set a goal to increase the weight you're lifting or the number of reps you're completing by a certain amount each week.\n2. **Master a new exercise**: Identify an exercise that challenges you, such as a squat or deadlift, and make it your goal to master it by the end of the month.\n3. **Improve your form**: Focus on perfecting your form and technique, and ask your instructor for feedback on your progress.\n4. **Complete a certain number of workouts**: Aim to complete a certain number of weightlifting workouts per month, and gradually increase the frequency over time.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Make your goals specific and measurable**: Instead of setting a goal to \"get better at Zumba,\" set a goal to \"master the salsa step by the end of the month.\"\n2. **Write down your goals**: Write down your goals and post them somewhere visible to remind yourself of what you're working towards.\n3. **Track your progress**: Use a workout log or app to track your progress and stay motivated.\n4. **Celebrate your successes**: Reward yourself when you reach your goals, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't meet them. Remember, progress takes time and patience!\n\nRemember to communicate your goals with Maria and your weightlifting instructor, and ask for their feedback and support. They can help you set realistic goals and provide guidance on how to achieve them. Good luck!",

      "memory": "Congratulations on setting goals to establish a better routine on weekends! Here are some tips to help you stay motivated to exercise and stick to your daily reading habit:\n\n**Exercise Motivation:**\n\n1. **Schedule it in**: Treat your weekend workouts as non-negotiable appointments. Write them down in your calendar and commit to them.\n2. **Find an exercise buddy**: Having someone to hold you accountable and share the experience with can be a great motivator.\n3. **Variety is key**: Mix up your routine to avoid boredom. Try new activities, join a fitness class, or experiment with online workout videos.\n4. **Set achievable goals**: Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, aim to exercise for 30 minutes, three times a week, and gradually increase the duration or frequency.\n5. **Reward yourself**: After a successful workout, treat yourself to something you enjoy, like a healthy smoothie or a relaxing bath.\n6. **Make it convenient**: Find exercises that can be done at home or nearby, so you can't use \"lack of time\" as an excuse.\n7. **Track your progress**: Use a fitness tracker, journal, or app to monitor your progress and celebrate small victories.\n\n**Reading Habit:**\n\n1. **Create a cozy reading nook**: Designate a comfortable spot where you can relax and focus on your reading.\n2. **Set a daily goal**: Commit to reading for a specific amount of time each day, e.g., 30 minutes or a chapter.\n3. **Choose engaging books**: Select books that interest you and keep you hooked, making it easier to stick to your habit.\n4. **Make it a ritual**: Establish a pre-reading routine, like making a cup of tea or coffee, to signal to your brain that it's reading time.\n5. **Track your progress**: Keep a reading log or use an app to track your progress, set reminders, and discover new books.\n6. **Join a book club or find a reading buddy**: Discussing what you've read with others can enhance your experience and motivate you to stay on track.\n7. **Audiobooks are an option**: If you're struggling to find time to sit and read, try listening to audiobooks during your daily commute, while exercising, or doing chores.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Start small**: Don't try to overhaul your entire routine at once. Begin with small, achievable changes and build upon them.\n2. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to have off days. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a workout or reading session. Just get back on track as soon as possible.\n3. **Celebrate milestones**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help motivate you to continue your routine.\n4. **Make it a habit**: Consistency is key. Try to perform your exercise and reading habits at the same time every day or week, so they become automatic.\n\nRemember, developing a new routine takes time and effort. Be patient, stay committed, and you'll find yourself looking forward to your weekend exercise and reading sessions!",
