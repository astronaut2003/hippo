You must be thrilled to be heading to one of the world's top universities.\n\nHere are some tips to help you navigate your first few weeks on campus:\n\n1. **Arrival and Move-In**:\n\t* Plan to arrive a few days before the official move-in date to get settled and acquainted with the area.\n\t* UC Berkeley offers an International Student Orientation program, which is highly recommended. It's a great way to meet other international students, get familiar with the campus, and learn about university resources.\n\t* If you're living in a residence hall, make sure to check-in during the designated move-in times to avoid any issues.\n2. **Getting Settled**:\n\t* Take some time to explore your new surroundings, including the campus, Berkeley city, and the Bay Area.\n\t* Set up your student account, get your Cal ID, and activate your UC Berkeley email address.\n\t* Familiarize yourself with the campus map, including the location of important buildings, libraries, and dining halls.\n3. **Academic Preparation**:\n\t* Review your course schedule and make sure you're enrolled in the correct classes.\n\t* Attend the International Student Orientation's academic advising session to discuss your course selection and any potential changes.\n\t* Get familiar with the UC Berkeley academic system, including the grading system, attendance policies, and assignment expectations.\n4. **Campus Resources**:\n\t* Explore the various student services and resources available on campus, such as the Student Union, Recreational Sports Facility, and the Tang Center (health and counseling services).\n\t* Take advantage of the university's language support services, if needed.\n5. **Socializing and Community Building**:\n\t* Attend the various welcome events and activities organized by the International Office, student organizations, and cultural groups.\n\t* Join clubs and organizations that align with your interests to meet like-minded people and build connections.\n\t* Don't be afraid to reach out to your fellow students, teaching assistants, or professors to ask questions or seek advice.\n6. **Logistics and Practicalities**:\n\t* Open a US bank account to manage your finances and receive your scholarship/stipend (if applicable).\n\t* Get a US phone number or a local SIM card for easy communication.\n\t* Explore transportation options, such as the campus shuttle, public transportation, or bike rentals.\n7. **Homesickness and Culture Shock**:\n\t* It's normal to feel overwhelmed or homesick during the initial adjustment period. Don't hesitate to reach out to the International Office or counseling services for support.\n\t* Be patient with yourself as you adapt to the new cultural environment, academic system, and social norms.\n\nRemember, your first few weeks will be a whirlwind of new experiences, but with an open mind, a positive attitude, and these tips, you'll be well on your way to a fantastic semester abroad at UC Berkeley!\n\nFeel free to ask me any specific questions you may have, and I'll do my best to help.",

This means you must have been physically present in the US for at least 913 days (30 months x 30.4 days per month) during the 5-year period.\n\n**Counting Days of Physical Presence:**\n\n1. **Start counting from the date of your last admission:** Begin counting your physical presence from the date you were last admitted to the US as a lawful permanent resident (green card holder).\n2. **Include days spent in the US:** Count all days you've spent in the US, including weekends, holidays, and days you were on vacation or sick leave.\n3. **Exclude days spent outside the US:** Do not count days you spent outside the US, including:\n\t* Trips abroad, even if you returned to the US the same day.\n\t* Time spent in a foreign country, even if you were on business or vacation.\n\t* Days you were in transit between the US and another country.\n4. **Calculate partial days:** If you were in the US for part of a day, count it as a full day. For example, if you entered the US on January 1 and departed on January 3, you would count 3 days of physical presence.\n\n**Documenting Your Physical Presence:**\n\n1. **Keep records:** Keep detailed records of your entries and exits from the US, including:\n\t* Passport stamps\n\t* I-94/I-94A forms (arrival/departure records)\n\t* Boarding passes\n\t* Travel itineraries\n\t* Hotel receipts or other proof of presence\n2. **Complete Form N-400:** When you apply for naturalization, you'll need to complete Form N-400, Application for Naturalization. You'll be asked to provide a detailed account of your physical presence in the US.\n\n**Tips and Exceptions:**\n\n1. **Continuous residence:** You don't need to have been physically present in the US for the entire 5-year period. You can take trips abroad, but you must maintain your continuous residence in the US.\n2. **Absences:** If you've been absent from the US for 6 months or more, you may be considered to have broken your continuous residence. However, you can still qualify for naturalization if you can show that you didn't intend to abandon your US residence.\n3. **Waivers:** In some cases, you may be eligible for a waiver of the physical presence requirement if you've been employed abroad by the US government, a US research institution, or a qualifying organization.\n\nRemember to carefully review the USCIS website and consult with an immigration attorney if you have any questions or concerns about the physical presence requirement or your specific situation.",

Prioritized examination (Track I): This option requires an additional fee, but it can result in a final disposition of the application within 12 months.\n\n2. Accelerated examination: This option requires a detailed application and a search report that must meet specific requirements. With this option, the USPTO aims to issue a final disposition within 12 months.\n\n3. Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH): This option allows an applicant who has received a favorable ruling from another patent office to request accelerated examination at the USPTO.\n\nIt is important to note that these accelerated options also require additional fees and may require additional resources or specialized knowledge. Working with a patent attorney can help navigate these options and ensure the application is processed as efficiently as possible.",
