Here's a brief rundown on the cards I mentioned earlier:\n\n1. **Citi Double Cash Card**:\n\t* Earn 2% cashback on all purchases: 1% when you buy, 1% when you pay your bill.\n\t* No rotating categories or spending limits on cashback.\n\t* No annual fee.\n\t* 0% intro APR for 18 months on balance transfers (then 15.74% - 25.74% Variable APR).\n2. **Chase Freedom Unlimited**:\n\t* Earn 3% cashback on all purchases in your first year, up to $20,000 spent.\n\t* After the first year, earn 1.5% cashback on all purchases.\n\t* No annual fee.\n\t* 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers (then 15.74% - 24.49% Variable APR).\n3. **Discover it Cash Back**:\n\t* Earn 5% cashback on various categories throughout the year, such as gas stations, grocery stores, or restaurants, up to $1,500 in combined purchases per quarter.\n\t* Earn 1% cashback on all other purchases.\n\t* No annual fee.\n\t* 0% intro APR for 14 months on purchases and balance transfers (then 12.74% - 23.74% Variable APR).\n\nAll of these cards have no annual fee, which is great! However, it's essential to note that you'll need to pay your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.\n\nSome other factors to consider when choosing a cashback credit card:\n\n* Credit score: You'll typically need a good credit score to qualify for these cards.\n* Introductory offers: Take advantage of the sign-up bonuses and 0% intro APR periods, but make sure you understand the regular APR and terms that apply after the intro period ends.\n* Rotating categories: Cards like Discover it Cash Back have rotating categories that require activation each quarter. Make sure you're comfortable with the process and can maximize your earnings.\n* Cashback redemption: Understand how to redeem your cashback rewards, as some cards may have minimum redemption thresholds or restrictions.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions carefully and use your credit card responsibly to avoid overspending and interest charges.\n\nDo you have any other questions about cashback credit cards or would you like more recommendations?",

It's been showing me that I've spent around $250 on groceries in the past two weeks, which is a bit above my target of $200.
