Here's why:\n\n1. **Inspection report findings**: The minor issues with the roof and plumbing do warrant some consideration. While they're not major concerns, they do require attention and will likely need to be addressed in the near future.\n2. **Initial credit already agreed upon**: The seller has already agreed to provide a $2,000 credit towards closing costs, which shows they're willing to work with you. Building on that, asking for an additional 1% of the purchase price is a reasonable escalation.\n3. **Local market conditions**: If you're in a buyer's market or a relatively balanced market, you may have more leverage to negotiate. Even in a seller's market, the seller may be willing to compromise to finalize the deal.\n\nTo make your request more effective, consider the following:\n\n1. **Emphasize the cumulative effect**: Highlight the total amount of credits you're requesting ($2,000 + $3,250 = $5,250) and how it will benefit both parties by facilitating a smoother closing process.\n2. **Be flexible**: Be open to negotiating the amount or finding alternative solutions, such as the seller paying for specific repairs or providing a home warranty.\n3. **Show your commitment**: Reiterate your enthusiasm for the property and your commitment to moving forward with the purchase, provided the seller is willing to work with you on the closing costs.\n\nHere's an example script to help you make your request:\n\n\"Hi [Seller's Agent], I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion regarding the inspection report. As you know, we did identify some minor issues with the roof and plumbing. While they're not major concerns, we do believe they warrant some consideration. Given our initial agreement on the $2,000 credit towards closing costs, I was wondering if the seller would be willing to consider an additional 1% of the purchase price ($3,250) to help cover the remaining closing costs. This would bring the total credit to $5,250 and would greatly help us in finalizing the deal. We're still very interested in the property and believe this is a reasonable request considering the inspection report findings. Let me know if this is something the seller would be open to discussing.\"\n\nRemember to stay calm, professional, and respectful during the negotiation process. Good luck!",

The general rule of thumb is to expect to pay between 2% to 5% of the purchase price in closing costs.

Just plug in the new price into the percentage ranges above to get an estimate.\n\nAdditionally, it's a good idea to factor in other costs associated with buying a home, such as:\n\n* Inspection fees (around $500 to $1,000)\n* Appraisal fees (around $300 to $1,000)\n* Title insurance and escrow fees (around $1,500 to $3,000)\n* Loan origination fees (around 0.5% to 1% of the loan amount)\n\nYour lender and real estate agent can provide more detailed estimates of these costs based on your specific situation.\n\nRemember to also consider other expenses associated with homeownership, such as property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, when calculating your overall affordability.\n\nGood luck with your home buying journey!",

This gives you some wiggle room to negotiate and potentially save some money.\n\nBy asking for a credit towards closing costs, you're essentially asking the seller to contribute a specific amount towards your closing costs, which can help reduce your out-of-pocket expenses. This can be beneficial, especially if you're already stretching your budget to purchase the property.\n\nOn the other hand, asking for a reduction in the sale price of $2,500 can also be a good option. This would directly reduce the purchase price of the property, which can be more appealing to you as a buyer.\n\nBy offering both options, you're giving the seller a choice and showing that you're willing to negotiate. This can help create a more collaborative and flexible atmosphere in the negotiation process.\n\nRemember to discuss this with Rachel, your agent, and have her help you present your request to the seller. She can provide valuable insights and guidance on how to negotiate effectively and get the best possible outcome.\n\nHere's an example of how the request could look:\n\n\"Dear Seller,\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation in addressing the issues found in the home inspection report. We would like to request that you fix the small leak in the roof and replace the worn-out carpeting in the bedrooms. If you're unable to complete these repairs, we would like to request a credit towards closing costs of $2,000 or a reduction in the sale price of $2,500 to offset the cost of these repairs.\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts on this request. We look forward to hearing back from you.\"\n\nGood luck with the negotiation, and I hope you get the outcome you're looking for!",
