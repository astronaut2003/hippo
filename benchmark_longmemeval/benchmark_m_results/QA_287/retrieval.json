      "memory": "Historical fiction novels can indeed vary in length, but on average, they tend to fall between 350-500 pages. However, it's not uncommon to find books that are longer, sometimes exceeding 600-800 pages.\n\nIn recent years, there's been a trend towards longer books in the historical fiction genre, possibly due to the complexity of the stories being told and the level of research involved. Authors like Hilary Mantel, Ken Follett, and Philippa Gregory are known for their detailed and immersive storytelling, which can result in longer page counts.\n\nThat being said, some historical fiction novels can be more concise, ranging from 250-350 pages. These books might focus on a specific event, time period, or character's story, allowing for a more streamlined narrative.\n\nIn the case of **The Alice Network**, the page count is around 432 pages in the hardcover edition, which is fairly typical for a historical fiction novel. **The Women in the Castle** has a slightly longer page count, around 512 pages in the hardcover edition.\n\nUltimately, the page count shouldn't deter you from reading a book. If the story and characters capture your interest, you'll likely find yourself invested in the narrative, regardless of the page count.\n\nDo you have a preferred page count or reading format (e.g., e-book, audiobook, physical book) that affects your reading experience?",

Physical books will always hold a special place in many readers' hearts, but audiobooks have become a great way to consume books, especially for commutes, workouts, or multitasking. The Libby app is an excellent resource, making it easy to access a vast library of audiobooks and e-books.\n\nUsing audiobooks to get through longer books is a great strategy. It can help you stay engaged and make progress on a book that might otherwise feel daunting. Plus, a good narrator can really bring the story to life!\n\nAs for page count, you're right that a concise story can be just as effective as a longer one. Sometimes, authors can convey the same emotional impact and depth in fewer pages, which is a testament to their skill. Of course, there are times when a longer book is necessary to tell a complex story or explore themes in depth.\n\nIt's great that you're open to experimenting with different formats and finding what works best for you. Have you noticed any differences in your reading experience between physical books and audiobooks? Do you find that you retain information or remember plot points differently between the two formats?\n\nAlso, are there any particular genres or types of books that you prefer to listen to as audiobooks, or do you stick to what you normally read in physical format?",

I find that it's a great way to get through books faster, especially longer ones. I've also started using the Libby app, which has been really convenient. As for page count, I don't have a strong preference, but I do appreciate it when authors can tell a compelling story in a more concise manner.",
