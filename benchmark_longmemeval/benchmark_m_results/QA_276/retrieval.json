You can also customize the columns to fit your needs, adding or removing categories as necessary.\n\nIf you'd like, you can also use a digital tool like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to create a spreadsheet to track your literary events. This would allow you to easily sort and filter your events by date, author, location, or other criteria.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
