      "memory": "Discounts on delivery fees are less common than discounts on food items, but they do exist.\n\nTypically, promotions and discounts on food delivery platforms like UberEats are applied to the food items themselves, rather than the delivery fee. This means that you're more likely to find discounts on specific menu items, combos, or bundles, rather than the delivery fee.\n\nHowever, there are some cases where you might be able to get a discount on the delivery fee:\n\n1. **First-time user discounts**: Some food delivery platforms offer discounts on the delivery fee for first-time users. These discounts are usually applied automatically during the checkout process.\n2. **Promo codes**: Occasionally, you might find promo codes that offer a discount on the delivery fee. These codes are usually limited to specific restaurants, areas, or time periods, so be sure to read the terms and conditions.\n3. **Free delivery**: Some restaurants or food delivery platforms offer free delivery on orders above a certain amount or on specific menu items. This can be a great way to save on the delivery fee.\n4. **Subscription services**: Some food delivery platforms offer subscription services that include discounts on delivery fees. For example, UberEats' Pass subscription service offers unlimited free delivery on eligible orders.\n5. **Limited-time offers**: During peak hours, special events, or holidays, food delivery platforms might offer discounts on delivery fees to incentivize orders.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a discount on the delivery fee, I recommend:\n\n* Checking the food delivery platform's website, social media, or app for promotions and offers.\n* Signing up for their email newsletter or loyalty program to receive exclusive offers.\n* Using cashback apps or browser extensions that offer rebates on food delivery fees.\n* Contacting the restaurant or food delivery platform directly to ask about any available discounts.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of any promo code or discount to ensure it's valid for your order and location.",

      "memory": "Discounts can vary, but I can give you some general insights.\n\nTypically, discounts on food delivery platforms like UberEats are applied to the entire order, rather than a specific dish. This means that if you have a promo code or discount, it will be deducted from the total cost of your order, including the veggie lasagna, any other items you've added, and any applicable fees.\n\nHowever, some restaurants might offer specific promotions or discounts on certain dishes, like \"Buy one get one free\" or \"10% off our veggie lasagna.\" These types of promotions are usually advertised on the restaurant's page on UberEats, their social media, or website.\n\nIn some cases, you might be able to find a promo code that's specific to a particular dish or menu category. For example, \"VEGGLASAGNA20\" might be a code that gives you 20% off the veggie lasagna. These codes are usually limited to specific restaurants or menu items, so be sure to read the terms and conditions before applying them.\n\nIf you're looking for a discount on the veggie lasagna specifically, I'd recommend checking the restaurant's page on UberEats, their social media, or website for any promotions or discounts. You can also try contacting the restaurant directly to ask if they have any special offers on that dish.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of any promo code or discount to ensure it's valid for your order and location.",

Here are some general observations:\n\n1. **Newly added restaurants**: Restaurants that are new to UberEats might offer promotions to attract more customers and build their reputation on the platform.\n2. **Chain restaurants**: Large chain restaurants, like McDonald's, Subway, or Pizza Hut, often have more resources to offer promotions and discounts to drive sales.\n3. **Fast food and quick service**: Fast food and quick-service restaurants, like burgers, sandwiches, or salads, might offer more promotions due to their high volume of orders and competitive market.\n4. **Asian cuisine**: Restaurants serving Asian food, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, often offer discounts or promotions, possibly due to the high demand for these cuisines on food delivery platforms.\n5. **Vegetarian or vegan options**: Restaurants with vegetarian or vegan options might offer promotions to attract customers with dietary restrictions or preferences.\n6. **Breakfast or brunch spots**: Restaurants serving breakfast or brunch might offer promotions during off-peak hours or weekdays to drive sales.\n7. **Local or independent eateries**: Smaller, independent restaurants might offer promotions to compete with larger chains and attract more customers to their business.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general trends and not hard and fast rules. Promotions can vary greatly depending on your location, the restaurant's target audience, and the time of year.\n\nTo increase your chances of finding promo codes or discounts, try the following:\n\n* Use the UberEats app or website to search for restaurants in these categories.\n* Filter your search by \"Deals\" or \"Promotions\" to find restaurants with active offers.\n* Check the restaurant's social media pages or website for exclusive promotions.\n* Sign up for the restaurant's loyalty program or email newsletter to receive exclusive offers.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of any promo code or discount to ensure it's valid for your order.",
