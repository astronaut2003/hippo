      "memory": "You're in for a treat with authentic Italian dishes! Carbonara and amatriciana are staples of Roman cuisine, and you'll find many restaurants serving them. I'll make sure to recommend some great spots for you to try them.\n\nThat's great to hear about your packing experiment in Paris! Traveling light can make a huge difference in terms of convenience and stress levels. Carry-on luggage is the way to go, especially if you're planning to explore Rome on foot or use public transportation. You'll appreciate the extra time you'll save at the airport, and you can focus on enjoying your trip instead of waiting at baggage claim.\n\nNow, back to food! For authentic carbonara and amatriciana, I recommend trying:\n\n1. **Trattoria al Moro** (mentioned earlier): Their carbonara is a must-try, made with guanciale (cured pork jowl), eggs, and parmesan cheese.\n2. **La Gensola**: A cozy trattoria in the heart of Trastevere, serving traditional Roman dishes like amatriciana, carbonara, and cacio e pepe. (Address: Piazza della Gensola, 15, 00153 Roma RM)\n3. **Il Conte di Cavour**: A historic trattoria near the Pantheon, offering classic Roman cuisine, including a delicious amatriciana made with guanciale and tomatoes. (Address: Via dei Conti di Cavour, 32, 00187 Roma RM)\n4. **Osteria dell'Angelo**: A family-run osteria in the Monti neighborhood, serving homemade pasta dishes like carbonara and amatriciana. (Address: Via G. Giolitti, 169, 00187 Roma RM)\n\nWhen trying these dishes, keep in mind that authentic Italian cuisine often features high-quality ingredients, simplicity, and a focus on letting the ingredients shine. You might be surprised by the lack of cream in carbonara or the use of guanciale instead of bacon.\n\nWhich of these restaurants resonates with you, or would you like more recommendations?",
