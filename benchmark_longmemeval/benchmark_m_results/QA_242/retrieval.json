While it may share some similarities with American Airlines, there are some differences you might appreciate.\n\nLufthansa's in-flight entertainment system is called \"Lufthansa Media World.\" Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. **Screen size and quality**: Lufthansa's screens are generally larger and more modern than those on American Airlines. You can expect a 12-inch HD screen in Economy Class, and up to 15 inches in Premium Economy and Business Class.\n2. **Content selection**: Lufthansa offers a vast library of movies, TV shows, music, and games. They claim to have over 200 movies, 150 TV shows, 1,000 CDs, and 100 games. They also feature a \"Lufthansa Exclusives\" section, which includes content not available on other airlines.\n3. **User interface**: The interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate. You can browse through the content using a touchscreen or a remote control. You can also create a personal playlist and save your favorite content for later.\n4. **Audio**: Lufthansa provides noise-cancelling headphones in all classes, which is a nice touch.\n5. **Power outlets and USB ports**: Most seats on Lufthansa aircraft have power outlets and USB ports, so you can keep your devices charged during the flight.\n\nSome differences you might notice compared to American Airlines:\n\n* Lufthansa's system is more modern and responsive, with faster loading times and fewer errors.\n* The content selection is more diverse, with a stronger focus on European cinema and TV shows.\n* The user interface is more visually appealing and easier to navigate.\n\nOverall, Lufthansa's in-flight entertainment system is a cut above what you might be used to on American Airlines.

The zero-gravity sequence involved building a rotating hallway set that rotated a full 360 degrees. A mobile gimbal was mounted beneath the rotating set, which allowed the actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ariadne, to perform the fight choreography in zero gravity. The sequence took six weeks to film and is considered one of the most memorable sequences in the film. The rotating set was so large that it had to be built at the Cardington Studios in Bedfordshire, England, which is one of the largest enclosed spaces in Europe.
