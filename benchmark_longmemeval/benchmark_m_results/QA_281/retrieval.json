Offering a \"sneak peek\" or early access to your Night Market Exclusive products to your email subscribers or social media followers can create a sense of exclusivity and make them feel special. It's a great way to reward your loyal followers and encourage them to share your products with their friends and family.\n\nHere are a few ways you could implement this:\n\n1. **Exclusive Pre-Sale**: Offer your email subscribers or social media followers a 24-48 hour pre-sale window to purchase your Night Market Exclusive products before they're available to the general public.\n2. **Sneak Peek**: Share behind-the-scenes content, such as product prototypes, packaging designs, or scent reveals, to give your followers a first look at your new products.\n3. **Early Access Code**: Provide a special promo code to your email subscribers or social media followers that grants them early access to your Night Market Exclusive products or a discount on their purchase.\n4. **VIP Preview Event**: Host a VIP preview event or online webinar for your loyal followers to get an exclusive first look at your new products and ask questions.\n\nBy offering a \"sneak peek\" or early access, you can:\n\n* Build anticipation and excitement for your Night Market Exclusive products\n* Encourage social sharing and word-of-mouth marketing\n* Reward your loyal followers and make them feel special\n* Generate buzz and drive sales before the Night Market event\n\nRemember to communicate clearly with your followers about the exclusive offer, including any deadlines, promo codes, or instructions on how to access the early access period.\n\nWhat do you think about offering a special \"Night Market Survival Kit\" or \"Winter Wellness Bundle\" that includes a selection of your products, along with some exclusive goodies like a candle, tea, or face mask?",

Since you haven't been reading as much lately, it's natural to wonder if it's worth continuing.\n\nIn this case, the $10 reward is a nice incentive to keep the membership active, especially if you were planning to make a purchase within the next two weeks anyway. Using the reward to buy a new book is a great way to get value out of the program.\n\nHowever, consider the following questions to help you make a decision:\n\n1. **Will you continue to shop at Barnes & Noble regularly?**: If you don't see yourself making frequent purchases at Barnes & Noble, the loyalty program might not be worth keeping.\n2. **Are there other loyalty programs that align better with your current habits?**: If you've shifted your shopping habits to other retailers or categories (e.g., coffee, groceries, or clothing), it might be more beneficial to focus on those loyalty programs instead.\n3. **What are the benefits of the Barnes & Noble loyalty program beyond the $10 reward?**: Are there other perks, such as exclusive discounts, early access to sales, or special events, that make the membership valuable to you?\n\nIf you decide to keep the membership, you can:\n\n* Take advantage of the $10 reward and use it to buy a new book or other items\n* Continue to earn points and rewards on your purchases\n* Enjoy any additional benefits the program offers\n\nOn the other hand, if you decide to cancel the membership, you can:\n\n* Focus on other loyalty programs that align better with your current habits\n* Avoid the temptation to make unnecessary purchases to earn rewards\n* Simplify your loyalty program portfolio and reduce clutter\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours. Weigh the pros and cons, and consider what's best for your shopping habits and priorities.\n\nWhat do you think? Will you keep the membership and enjoy the $10 reward, or cancel it and focus on other loyalty programs?",
