Taylor has brought a new offensive scheme to the team, which emphasizes spreading the field with multiple receivers and utilizing a variety of formations, including empty backfields and pre-snap motion. The offense is designed to take advantage of the team's skilled position players, including quarterback Joe Burrow and wide receivers Tyler Boyd and Tee Higgins.\n\nSome notable changes in the Bengals' offensive strategy include increased use of play-action passes and screen plays, as well as a focus on quick passing and getting the ball out of the quarterback's hand quickly, which helps to mitigate the opponent's pass rush. The team has also shown a greater willingness to take calculated risks on fourth downs, going for it more often in these situations than they did under Marvin Lewis.\n\nTaylor and his offensive staff have also incorporated elements of the Los Angeles Rams' offensive system, which Taylor learned under Rams head coach Sean McVay when he served as the Rams' quarterback coach in 2018. This has included the use of jet sweep motions and other misdirection plays to keep defenses off-balance and create favorable matchups for the Bengals' offensive players.",
