I'd be happy to recommend some recent RPGs that would work well with the processor you choose.\n\nHere are some fantastic RPGs from the past few years, categorized by their system requirements:\n\n**Less Demanding RPGs (Should run smoothly on mid-range CPUs):**\n\n1. **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt** (2015) - A classic action RPG with a deep storyline and engaging combat.\n2. **Divinity: Original Sin 2** (2017) - A highly interactive RPG with a rich story, complex combat, and co-op multiplayer.\n3. **Pillars of Eternity** (2015) - A CRPG with a deep story, engaging combat, and a beautiful world to explore.\n4. **Tyranny** (2016) - A dark fantasy RPG with a strong focus on storytelling and player choice.\n\n**Moderately Demanding RPGs (Should run smoothly on mid-to-high-end CPUs):**\n\n1. **Cyberpunk 2077** (2020) - A futuristic RPG with a rich storyline, engaging combat, and a vast open world to explore.\n2. **The Outer Worlds** (2019) - A sci-fi RPG with a humorous tone, engaging combat, and a rich storyline.\n3. **Borderlands 3** (2019) - A cooperative first-person shooter RPG with a colorful art style and addictive loot system.\n4. **Wasteland 3** (2020) - A post-apocalyptic RPG with tactical combat, a rich story, and co-op multiplayer.\n\n**Demanding RPGs (May require high-end CPUs for optimal performance):**\n\n1. **Elder Scrolls Online** (2014, but with frequent updates) - A massive MMORPG with a rich storyline, engaging combat, and a vast open world.\n2. **Final Fantasy XV** (2016) - An action RPG with a beautiful open world, engaging combat, and a deep storyline.\n3. **Monster Hunter: World** (2018) - An action RPG with a vast open world, intense combat, and co-op multiplayer.\n4. **Dragon Age: Inquisition** (2014) - A high-fantasy RPG with a rich story, engaging combat, and a vast open world.\n\nKeep in mind that system requirements can vary depending on the specific game settings and resolutions you choose. However, these recommendations should give you a good starting point.\n\nWhen choosing a processor, consider the following:\n\n* If you prefer less demanding RPGs, a mid-range processor like the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i5-11600K should be sufficient.\n* For moderately demanding RPGs, a mid-to-high-end processor like the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Intel Core i7-11700K would be a good choice.\n* If you want to play the most demanding RPGs at high settings, a high-end processor like the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X or Intel Core i9-11900K would be the way to go.\n\nRemember to also consider other system components, such as your graphics card, RAM, and storage, when building your gaming PC.",

It's a very accessible game, and its simplicity belies its depth.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that Pandemic was a bit too complicated for you, but I'm glad you enjoyed the cooperative aspect! If you're interested in cooperative games, you might want to check out Forbidden Island or Forbidden Desert, which are both part of the same series as Pandemic, but are a bit more streamlined and easier to learn.\n\nAnd yes, I'm familiar with Scattergories! It's a great party game that encourages creative thinking and wordplay. It's perfect for playing with a group of friends, and it's a great way to get everyone laughing and engaged. The game's mechanism of coming up with words that fit certain categories, all starting with the same letter, is really clever and challenging.\n\nIf you enjoyed Scattergories, you might also want to check out other party games like Codenames, Taboo, or Dixit. They all offer a similar type of social, interactive gameplay that's great for playing with a group of friends.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
