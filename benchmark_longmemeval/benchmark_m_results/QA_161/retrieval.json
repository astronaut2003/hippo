Congratulations on the waterproof car cover, that's a great purchase! $120 is a reasonable price for a good quality cover.\n\nAs for a detailing kit, there are many options available, and the best one for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **What type of detailing do you want to do?** Do you want a kit for general cleaning and maintenance, or do you want to get into more advanced detailing like paint correction, ceramic coating, or interior detailing?\n2. **What's your budget?** Detailing kits can range from under $50 to over $500, so set a budget and look for kits that fit within it.\n3. **What's your car's paint type?** If you have a sensitive paint finish, you may want a kit that's specifically designed for your paint type.\n\nHere are some popular detailing kit options:\n\n**Basic/Beginner Kits**\n\n* Meguiar's Complete Car Care Kit (~ $50) - A great starter kit with a variety of products for cleaning and protecting your car's exterior and interior.\n* Chemical Guys Car Care Kit (~ $70) - Another popular kit with a range of products for cleaning, polishing, and protecting your car.\n\n**Intermediate Kits**\n\n* Autoglym Car Care Kit (~ $150) - A more advanced kit with higher-end products for cleaning, polishing, and protecting your car's paint, wheels, and interior.\n* Griot's Garage Car Care Kit (~ $200) - A comprehensive kit with a wide range of products for cleaning, polishing, and protecting your car's exterior and interior.\n\n**Advanced Kits**\n\n* detailing clay bar kit (~ $100-$200) - If you want to get into paint correction and removing contaminants from your car's paint, a clay bar kit is a great investment.\n* Ceramic coating kit (~ $200-$500) - If you want to apply a ceramic coating to your car's paint for long-term protection, a kit can be a good option.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many other options available.

      "memory": "Getting a dash cam is a great investment for your vehicle's safety and security.\n\nRegarding your question, it's possible to claim the cost of the waterproof car cover on your car insurance, but it depends on your insurance provider and policy. Some insurance companies may consider a waterproof car cover as a valid accessory that can help reduce the risk of damage to your vehicle's paint and interior.\n\nHowever, you'll need to check your insurance policy to see if it covers accessories like car covers. You may also want to contact your insurance provider directly to ask about their policy on reimbursing the cost of a car cover.\n\nTypically, insurance companies will reimburse you for accessories that are specifically listed in your policy or that are deemed necessary to prevent damage to your vehicle. If your policy doesn't explicitly cover car covers, you may still be able to claim it as a miscellaneous expense or as part of a package deal with other accessories.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll need to provide proof of purchase and documentation showing that the car cover was specifically designed to protect your vehicle's paint and interior. You may also need to provide evidence that the car cover has been used consistently and has helped prevent damage to your vehicle.\n\nIt's always a good idea to review your insurance policy and discuss your options with your insurance provider to determine the best course of action.\n\nI hope that helps, and I'm sure you'll get a clear answer from your insurance provider.",
