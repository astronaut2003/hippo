Organizing all those memories can be a bit overwhelming, but with a few tips, you'll be able to create a beautiful and cohesive album.\n\n**Gather and categorize:**\n\n1. **Collect photos:** Dig out old photo albums, scrapbooks, and digital folders. Ask Sarah to do the same. You can also ask other mutual friends or family members if they have any photos of the two of you.\n2. **Categorize by era:** Divide your photos into categories based on time periods, such as \"College Days,\" \"Post-Grad Adventures,\" \"Special Events,\" or \"Everyday Moments.\"\n3. **Create a timeline:** Establish a rough timeline of your friendship, noting significant events, milestones, and memories. This will help you place your photos and memorabilia in context.\n\n**Organize digital files:**\n\n1. **Create a shared folder:** Make a shared digital folder or album on Google Drive, Dropbox, or a cloud storage service, where you and Sarah can upload your photos and files.\n2. **Use folders and subfolders:** Organize your digital files into folders and subfolders, mirroring your categorization system.\n3. **Tag and label:** Use keywords, tags, or labels to identify specific events, people, or places in your digital photos.\n\n**Physical organization:**\n\n1. **Use acid-free materials:** Choose acid-free paper, glue, and other materials to ensure your photos and memorabilia remain preserved.\n2. **Sort and categorize physically:** Organize your physical photos and memorabilia into categories, using folders, envelopes, or boxes.\n3. **Use photo sleeves or pockets:** Use photo sleeves or pockets to protect and store your physical photos, making it easier to add them to the album.\n\n**Tips for incorporating memorabilia:**\n\n1. **Digitize memorabilia:** Scan or take high-quality photos of physical memorabilia, like tickets, postcards, or notes, to include in your album.\n2. **Choose a few select items:** Select a few special items to include in the album, rather than overwhelming it with too many memorabilia.\n3. **Use adhesive or pockets:** Use acid-free adhesive or pockets to attach memorabilia to the album pages, ensuring they're secure and won't damage the photos.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to gather, organize, and showcase your cherished memories in a beautiful and meaningful way. Have fun revisiting your past and creating a stunning photo album with Sarah!",

It may take time to fully grasp its nuances, and that's okay. The goal is not to intellectualize impermanence, but to integrate it into your daily life and relationships.\n\nRemember to be gentle with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance. Your grandma's near-death experience has given you a unique opportunity to explore the mysteries of life and death, and I'm honored to have been a part of your journey.\n\nAs you continue on this path, I offer you a final quote from the Buddha:\n\n\"The impermanent is not worth clinging to. The impermanent is not worth attachment. The impermanent is not worth identifying with. The impermanent is not self.\"\n\nMay these words guide you on your journey, and may you find peace, wisdom, and appreciation for the present moment.\n\nWishing you all the best on your continued exploration of impermanence!",
