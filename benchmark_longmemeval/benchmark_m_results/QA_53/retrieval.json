I'm happy to help you navigate the world of sustainable skincare options.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for taking the first step towards reducing waste and exploring eco-friendly alternatives. It's fantastic that you're also adopting a more sustainable approach to fashion through thrift shopping and online marketplaces like eBay and Poshmark.\n\nNow, let's dive into the world of eco-friendly skincare:\n\n**Lush and The Ordinary are great options:**\n\n1. **Lush**: Known for their strong stance on sustainability, Lush uses minimal packaging, and most of their products are free from animal testing, synthetic fragrances, and chemicals. They also have a recycling program, which encourages customers to return empty containers in exchange for rewards.\n2. **The Ordinary**: This affordable brand is part of the DECIEM family, which prioritizes sustainability. They use recyclable packaging, minimize waste, and offer a recycling program for their products.\n\n**Other eco-friendly skincare brands to consider:**\n\n1. **Burt's Bees**: This natural skincare brand uses eco-friendly packaging, sources ingredients sustainably, and has a strong commitment to environmental responsibility.\n2. **Acure**: Acure is a USDA-certified organic brand that uses recyclable packaging and sustainable ingredients.\n3. **Andalou Naturals**: This brand uses eco-friendly packaging, sources ingredients sustainably, and donates a portion of their profits to environmental organizations.\n4. **Juice Beauty**: This organic skincare brand uses sustainable packaging, sources ingredients from organic farms, and is certified by the Leaping Bunny Program (cruelty-free).\n\n**Tips for making the switch:**\n\n1. **Gradual transition**: Don't feel pressured to switch all your products at once.
