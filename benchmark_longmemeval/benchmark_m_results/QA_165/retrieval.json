      "memory": "It's essential to verify that the courses you take online will transfer to your university and count towards your degree. Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. **Check your university's policy**: Review your university's transfer credit policy to understand their requirements and procedures for accepting credits from online courses. You can usually find this information on your university's website or by contacting their admissions or registrar's office.\n2. **Verify the course equivalency**: Reach out to your university's department or advisor to discuss the course you're interested in taking online. Ask them to evaluate the course and determine if it's equivalent to a course offered at your university. They may request the course syllabus, description, or other materials to make this determination.\n3. **Look for articulation agreements**: Some online platforms, like Coursera and edX, have articulation agreements with specific universities. These agreements outline which courses are eligible for transfer credit. Check the platform's website or contact their support team to see if they have an agreement with your university.\n4. **Check for ACE credit recommendations**: The American Council on Education (ACE) reviews and recommends online courses for college credit. Look for courses with ACE credit recommendations, as many universities accept these credits. You can search the ACE website for courses with credit recommendations.\n5. **Get pre-approval**: Before enrolling in an online course, get pre-approval from your university to ensure the credits will transfer. This may involve submitting a course proposal or request to your university's transfer credit office.\n6. **Keep documentation**: Keep all documentation related to the course, including the syllabus, assignments, and grades. Your university may require this documentation to evaluate the course for transfer credit.\n\nSome additional tips:\n\n* Be aware that transfer credits may have expiration dates, so plan accordingly.\n* Some universities may have specific requirements for online courses, such as proctored exams or specific platforms.\n* If you're planning to pursue a graduate degree, research the transfer credit policies of potential graduate programs as well.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the online courses you take will transfer to your university and count towards your degree.",
