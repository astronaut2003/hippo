      "memory": "Adding a treasure chest or a sunken ship decoration can be a great idea to create more hiding places for your neon tetras and other fish. Both decorations can provide a fun and interesting addition to your tank. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Treasure Chest:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Provides a cozy, enclosed space for fish to hide and feel secure\n* Can be placed on the substrate or on a rock, offering multiple hiding options\n* Often has small crevices and details that fish can explore\n\nCons:\n\n* Might be too small for larger fish like the Pleco catfish\n* Could be a bit too \"busy\" or ornate for a natural, planted tank\n\n**Sunken Ship:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Offers multiple hiding places and levels for fish to explore\n* Can be a great centerpiece for the tank, creating a focal point\n* Often has a more natural, weathered look that can blend with the tank's decor\n\nCons:\n\n* Might be too large for a 20-gallon tank, depending on the size\n* Could obstruct swimming space or create dead zones if not placed carefully\n\nConsidering your tank's size and the fish you have, I think a treasure chest might be a better fit. It's generally smaller and more compact, making it easier to place in a 20-gallon tank. Additionally, it provides a cozy, enclosed space that neon tetras and other small fish will appreciate.\n\nIf you do decide to go with a sunken ship, make sure to choose a smaller one that won't overwhelm the tank. You can also try placing it in a corner or against a wall to create a sense of depth and visual interest.\n\nRemember to introduce the new decoration slowly and carefully to avoid stressing your fish. You can start by placing it in a quiet area of the tank and then move it to its final location once the fish are comfortable with its presence.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards a treasure chest or a sunken ship?",

Adding schooling fish like lemon tetras or zebra danios can indeed help distract them and reduce aggression, but it's essential to consider a few things before making any additions:\n\n1. **Gourami compatibility:** Gouramis, especially males, can be quite aggressive towards other fish, especially those with long fins or similar shapes. Lemon tetras and zebra danios are generally peaceful, but they might still be targeted by aggressive gouramis. Make sure your gouramis are not overly aggressive and are compatible with the schooling fish you plan to add.\n2. **Tank size and space:** A 20-gallon tank can be a bit small for multiple species, especially if you already have gouramis. Ensure you have enough space for the schooling fish to swim and establish their own territory without feeling crowded or harassed.\n3. **Feeding dynamics:** Gouramis are opportunistic feeders and might see the schooling fish as competition for food. Make sure to provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers to reduce competition during feeding times. You can also try feeding your gouramis separately or using a feeding ring to contain their food.\n4. **Schooling fish size:** Lemon tetras and zebra danios are small fish, and gouramis might see them as prey. Ensure the schooling fish are large enough to not be seen as a snack by your gouramis.\n\nIf you've considered these factors and still want to add schooling fish, here are some tips to help reduce aggression:\n\n* **Introduce the schooling fish in a group:** Adding a school of 10-15 lemon tetras or zebra danios can help distract your gouramis and reduce aggression.\n* **Provide plenty of hiding places:** Add plants, rocks, or other decorations to create hiding places and visual barriers, which can help reduce aggression and stress.\n* **Increase water changes:** Regular water changes can help reduce aggression and stress in your tank.\n* **Monitor and adjust:** Observe your tank closely and be prepared to make adjustments if you notice any signs of aggression or stress.\n\nRemember, every tank is unique, and what works for one tank might not work for another. Keep a close eye on your tank's dynamics, and be prepared to make changes if necessary.",

      "memory": "That's a fantastic idea! Creating a \"city\" area with the treasure chest, artificial coral, and rocks can provide a fascinating environment for your fish to explore. The treasure chest will add a fun, whimsical element to the tank, and the coral and rocks will provide a natural, textured backdrop.\n\nBy placing the treasure chest near the coral and rocks, you'll create a visually appealing area that will encourage your fish to swim in and out of the structures, exploring every nook and cranny. The treasure chest's enclosed space will provide a cozy hiding place for your neon tetras and other small fish, while the coral and rocks will offer additional hiding spots and visual interest.\n\nTo make the most of this \"city\" area, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Create a sense of depth**: Place the treasure chest at an angle or slightly buried in the substrate to create a sense of depth and visual interest.\n2. **Add some greenery**: Consider adding some live plants or artificial plants around the treasure chest and coral to create a more natural, lush environment.\n3. **Vary the heights**: Use rocks and coral to create different levels and heights around the treasure chest, allowing your fish to swim up and down and explore the different areas.\n4. **Leave some open space**: Make sure to leave some open swimming space around the treasure chest and coral to allow your fish to swim freely and easily.\n\nBy creating this \"city\" area, you'll provide a stimulating environment for your fish to thrive in. They'll love exploring the treasure chest, coral, and rocks, and you'll enjoy watching them dart in and out of the structures.\n\nHow do you plan to arrange the treasure chest, coral, and rocks in your tank?",
