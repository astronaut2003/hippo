Community Engagement - Hosting a major event provides an opportunity for community engagement and can help to highlight the unique cultural and social aspects of a city. Many host cities have used the event to showcase local artists, musicians, and cultural festivals, which helps to bring communities together and promote a sense of civic pride.\n\n2. Environmental Sustainability - Major sporting events often have a significant impact on the environment, particularly in terms of carbon emissions and waste management. Many host cities have implemented green initiatives to promote environmental sustainability, such as the use of renewable energy, waste reduction, and public transportation usage.\n\n3. Legacy and Long-Term Benefits - Successful events should leave a positive legacy for the host city and its residents. This could include improved infrastructure, the creation of new jobs, the establishment of new businesses and industries, and sustainable long-term economic benefits.\n\nIn summary, while economic benefits are often the primary focus of major sporting events, other factors such as community engagement, environmental sustainability, and long-term legacy should also be taken into consideration to ensure that the event brings lasting benefits to the host city and its residents.",
