Let it sit for 1-2 hours, then run hot water through the disposal to rinse.\n2. **Ice and Rock Salt:** Place a few ice cubes and 1 tablespoon of rock salt down the disposal. Run cold water while grinding the mixture to help scrub away debris and odors.\n3. **Lemon Juice and Baking Soda:** Cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the disposal. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain, then run hot water to rinse.\n4. **Regular Maintenance:** Run cold water through the disposal while it's running to help move food particles and debris through the system.\n5. **Deodorize:** Cut a lemon or orange into small pieces and grind them in the disposal to leave a fresh scent.\n\n**Signs It's Time to Replace Your Garbage Disposal:**\n\n1. **Age:** If your disposal is over 10-15 years old, it may be nearing the end of its lifespan.\n2. **Frequent Clogs:** If you're experiencing frequent clogs or slow draining, it might be time to consider replacing the disposal.\n3. **Leaks:** If you notice water leaking from the disposal or pipes, it's likely a sign of a worn-out or damaged unit.\n4. **Unpleasant Odors:** If despite regular cleaning, your disposal still emits strong, unpleasant odors, it may be time to replace it.\n5. **Noise:** If your disposal is making unusual, loud noises or vibrating excessively, it could be a sign of worn-out bearings or other internal issues.\n6. **Corrosion:** If you notice rust or corrosion on the disposal or pipes, it's likely a sign of a worn-out unit.\n\n**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**\n\n1. **Jammed Disposal:** If your disposal won't turn on, try resetting it by pressing the reset button (usually located on the bottom of the unit).\n2. **Clogs:** Use a drain snake or plunger to clear blockages.

I'm glad to hear you're enjoying cooking with it.\n\nNow, about preventing sticky or clumpy noodles in Japchae:\n\n1. **Rinse the noodles thoroughly**: After soaking the noodles, make sure to rinse them thoroughly in cold water to remove excess starch. This helps prevent the noodles from becoming sticky or clumpy.\n2. **Use the right amount of oil**: Using the right amount of oil is crucial. If the pan is too dry, the noodles will stick together. If there's too much oil, the noodles will become greasy. Aim for a moderate amount of oil, just enough to coat the bottom of the pan.\n3. **Stir-fry quickly and constantly**: Stir-frying the noodles quickly and constantly helps to prevent them from sticking together. Use a gentle, sweeping motion to stir the noodles, and make sure to scrape the bottom of the pan to prevent the noodles from forming a sticky layer.\n4. **Add the noodles in batches (optional)**: If you find that the noodles are still sticking together, try adding them in batches to the pan. This will help to prevent overcrowding and allow each batch of noodles to cook evenly.\n5. **Use a non-stick wok or pan**: If you're using a non-stick wok or pan, it will definitely help to prevent the noodles from sticking. However, even with a non-stick surface, it's still important to use the right amount of oil and stir-fry the noodles quickly.\n6. **Don't overcook the noodles**: Japchae noodles should be cooked until they're slightly tender but still retain some crunch. Overcooking the noodles can cause them to become mushy and sticky.\n7. **Add a little water or broth**: If you notice the noodles starting to stick together, you can add a small amount of water or broth to the pan to help loosen them up. This will also help to create a saucy consistency.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a delicious and well-textured Japchae dish with noodles that are cooked to perfection.\n\nHow's your wok performing so far? Is it a carbon steel, cast iron, or non-stick wok?",
