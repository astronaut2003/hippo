Since you loved MoMA's Impressionist collection, I'll suggest some museums that might interest you:\n\n1. **The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)**: As one of the world's largest and most famous museums, The Met has an impressive collection of Impressionist and Modern art, including works by Monet, Renoir, and Degas. Be sure to explore the Temple of Dendur, a 2,000-year-old Egyptian temple, and the Met's iconic Great Hall.\n2. **The Guggenheim Museum**: Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, this iconic museum features a unique spiral architecture that's a work of art in itself. The Guggenheim has an impressive collection of modern and contemporary art, including works by Kandinsky, Klee, and Miró.\n3. **The Frick Collection**: This smaller, more intimate museum is located in the former mansion of Henry Clay Frick and features an outstanding collection of Old Master paintings, including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Whistler. The Frick's courtyard garden is also a peaceful oasis in the middle of Manhattan.\n4. **The Whitney Museum of American Art**: While not exclusively focused on Impressionism, the Whitney has an impressive collection of American art from the early 20th century, including works by the Ashcan School, the Harlem Renaissance, and Abstract Expressionism.\n5. **The Morgan Library & Museum**: This museum is a hidden gem, located in a stunning neoclassical building. The Morgan features a diverse collection of art and literature, including rare books, manuscripts, and prints. Their temporary exhibitions are often focused on Impressionist and Modern art.\n\nOther tips and suggestions:\n\n* Consider purchasing a museum pass, which can help you save time and money by granting you admission to multiple museums.\n* Plan your visits according to the museums' locations and opening hours to make the most of your time in NYC.\n* Take breaks and enjoy the city's parks, food, and street art between museum visits.\n* If you're interested in exploring more of NYC's art scene, consider visiting some of the smaller, independent galleries in Chelsea or the Lower East Side.\n\nI hope you enjoy your next NYC adventure!",
