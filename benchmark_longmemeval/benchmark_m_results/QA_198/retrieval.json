I exist solely to provide information and assist with tasks through text-based conversations. However, I can suggest a few ways to find great Korean restaurants in your area:\n\n1. **Online Review Sites**: Check out review platforms like Yelp, Google Reviews, or TripAdvisor to see what others have to say about Korean restaurants in your city. You can filter the results by rating, price, and location to find the best options.\n2. **Food Blogs and Social Media**: Look for local food bloggers or social media influencers who specialize in Korean cuisine. They often share reviews, recommendations, and behind-the-scenes stories about their dining experiences.\n3. **Korean Communities or Cultural Centers**: Reach out to local Korean communities, cultural centers, or language exchange groups. They might have recommendations or insider knowledge about authentic Korean restaurants in your area.\n4. **Ask Around**: Ask your friends, colleagues, or acquaintances who have tried Korean food before for their recommendations. Personal referrals can be a great way to discover hidden gems.\n\nRemember to always check menus, prices, and hours of operation before visiting a new restaurant to ensure it fits your preferences and schedule.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find an amazing Korean restaurant in your city!",

If you can't find them, you can also make your own kimchi at home!\n\nAs for the amount of kimchi to use, start with about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of kimchi, depending on how spicy and sour you like your stir-fry. You can always add more kimchi to taste.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your new faucet is working out well for you!
