Here are some fun and engaging game and activity ideas that are suitable for a mixed group of adults and kids at the baby shower:\n\n**Games:**\n\n1. **Baby Bingo**: Create bingo cards with words related to babies or baby showers. As Rachel opens gifts, players mark off the words they see. The first to get five in a row wins!\n2. **Guess the Baby Food**: Prepare several different baby foods, such as applesauce or carrots. Players must guess the flavor without looking at the label.\n3. **Pin the Pacifier on the Baby**: A baby shower twist on the classic game! Create a large picture of a baby, and have players take turns blindfolded and try to pin a pacifier on the baby's mouth.\n4. **Baby Shower Charades**: Write down baby-related words or phrases (e.g., \"changing a diaper,\" \"rocking a baby to sleep\") on slips of paper, and have players act them out for the others to guess.\n\n**Activities:**\n\n1. **Onesie Decorating Station**: Provide blank onesies, fabric paint, and other craft supplies. Let guests decorate their own onesies for Emily, and Rachel can take them home as a keepsake.\n2. **Baby Advice and Wishes**: Set up a station with cards or a guestbook where guests can write down their advice, wishes, or words of encouragement for Rachel and Mark as new parents.\n3. **Kids' Craft Corner**: Set up a table with coloring pages, crayons, and other craft supplies. This will keep the kids entertained while the adults socialize.\n4. **Scavenger Hunt**: Create a list of baby-related items (e.g., a baby block, a pacifier, a baby book) and have guests search for them around the party area.\n\n**Other Ideas:**\n\n1. **Photobooth**: Set up a photobooth with props like baby blocks, pacifiers, and onesies. This will encourage fun and silly photos with the guests.\n2. **Baby-Themed Snacks and Drinks**: Serve snacks and drinks that fit the baby theme, such as \"Baby Bottle\" punch, \"Onesie\" cookies, and \"Baby Carrot\" snacks.\n3. **Guess the Baby's Weight**: Have guests guess the weight of the baby, and the person who guesses correctly wins a prize!\n\nRemember to keep the games and activities simple and enjoyable for both adults and kids.

A unique and personalized hashtag can add an extra layer of fun to your wedding celebration and make it easier for your guests to share their photos and memories on social media. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Play on Your Names**: Combine your names, initials, or a special nickname to create a unique hashtag. For example, #SmithToBe, #JenAndMikeTieTheKnot, or #TheAdventuresOfABandC.\n2. **Incorporate a Special Date**: Use the date you met, your first date, or the proposal date to create a meaningful hashtag. For example, #LoveFoundOnFebruary12, #OurFirstDateWasMagic, or #HeProposedOnChristmas.\n3. **Reflect Your Interests**: If you both share a common hobby or interest, incorporate it into your hashtag. For example, #LoveIsInTheVine (for wine enthusiasts), #AdventureSeekersUnite, or #MusicToOurEars.\n4. **Personalize a Popular Phrase**: Take a popular phrase or quote and make it your own by adding your names or a special twist. For example, #HappilyEverLaughter (instead of \"happily ever after\"), #LoveIsInTheDetailsAB, or #YouHadMeAtHelloMike.\n5. **Create a Pun**: Puns can be a fun and lighthearted way to express your personalities. For example, #PawsitiveVibesOnly (if you both love animals), #BrewingUpLove (if you're coffee lovers), or #S'moreLoveAB (if you love camping or s'mores).\n\nRemember to keep your hashtag:\n\n* Short and easy to remember\n* Unique and not already in use\n* Relevant to your personalities, interests, or love story\n* Consistent across all social media platforms\n\nTake your time, have fun, and experiment with different combinations until you find the perfect hashtag that reflects your love and personalities!",

The good news is that there's no specific age limit for pursuing a master's degree, and many people successfully earn their master's in their 30s, 40s, and even 50s.\n\nAccording to the Council of Graduate Schools, the average age of students pursuing a master's degree in the United States is around 29-30 years old. However, this number can vary depending on the institution, program, and field of study.\n\nHere are some age demographics for master's degree students in the US:\n\n* 24-29 years old: 43.1%\n* 30-34 years old: 26.4%\n* 35-39 years old: 17.1%\n* 40-44 years old: 8.3%\n* 45-49 years old: 4.2%\n* 50 years old or older: 2.9%\n\nAs you can see, a significant portion of master's degree students are in their 30s, and many are even older. Your age of 32 is well within the range of typical master's degree students.\n\nIt's essential to remember that age is not a barrier to pursuing higher education. Many students take time off after their undergraduate degree to gain work experience, travel, or start a family, and then return to school to further their education.\n\nWhat's more important than your age is your motivation, dedication, and willingness to learn. If you're passionate about your field and want to advance your career or transition into a new one, now is a great time to consider pursuing a master's degree.\n\nTake your time to research programs, talk to advisors, and weigh the pros and cons. You've got this, and your 30s can be a fantastic decade for personal and professional growth!",
