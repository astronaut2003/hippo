Manitoba's curriculum is divided into six areas of learning called \"clusters,\" including: arts education, English language arts, mathematics, physical education/health education, science, and social studies. In Manitoba, high school students are required to earn a certain number of credits to graduate, with specific credits required in various subject areas.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, the K-12 curriculum is also divided into various subject areas, including: arts education, English language arts, mathematics, physical education/health education, science, and social studies. Saskatchewan's curriculum requires students to develop foundational skills in key subject areas while providing numerous opportunities to explore their areas of interest. Saskatchewan high school students must earn a specific number of credits to graduate, with a minimum of 24 credits required for a standard high school diploma.
