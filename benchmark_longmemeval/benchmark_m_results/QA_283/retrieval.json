However, I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to real-time information or specific details about a particular church or its services. But I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. **Church Website**: You can check the website of St. Mary's Church to see if they post their sermon schedules, readings, or bulletins online. Many churches provide this information on their websites or social media pages.\n2. **Catholic Church Resources**: Since you mentioned that St. Mary's is a Catholic church, you can check the official website of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) or the Vatican's website for the Sunday readings and reflections. They often provide the readings and reflections for each Sunday.\n3. **Contact the Church Directly**: You can reach out to St. Mary's Church directly via phone or email to ask about the readings and sermon schedule for this Sunday. They may be able to provide you with the information you're looking for.\n\nRemember to also check the church's service schedule and plan to arrive a little early to get settled before the service begins.\n\nIt's great that you're considering attending a service and reflecting on your faith. I hope you have a meaningful experience, and I'm sure Father John's sermon will be thought-provoking as always!",

      "memory": "In Islam, Friday prayer or Jummah is considered a congregational prayer that is mandatory for male Muslims to attend in a mosque or a designated prayer area. The Friday prayer is unique as it includes a sermon or Khutbah delivered by an Imam or a designated scholar, followed by a congregational prayer performed in congregation. \n\nThe importance of attending Friday prayer services at the mosque is emphasized in Islamic teachings. It is considered an obligation for Muslim men to attend the Friday prayer, and the reward for attending the Friday prayer is said to be greater than the reward for praying alone. \n\nThere are several benefits to attending Friday prayer services at the mosque. Firstly, attending Friday prayer allows Muslims to connect with their local community and foster a sense of brotherhood and sisterhood. Secondly, the Khutbah or sermon delivered during Friday prayer provides an opportunity for Muslims to learn about Islamic teachings and guidance on how to live a more pious life. Additionally, attending Friday prayers helps Muslims to re-focus their attention on their faith and spirituality, and seek Allah's forgiveness and blessings.\n\nTherefore, attending Friday prayer services at the mosque is considered an important aspect of the Muslim faith, as it brings Muslims together in prayer and fosters a sense of community and brotherhood, helps Muslims to learn more about Islam and live a more pious life, and provides an opportunity to seek Allah's forgiveness and blessings.",
