Here are some tips to help you improve your Ken playstyle, especially with his V-Skill:\n\n**Ken's V-Skill: Focus Attack**\n\nKen's V-Skill, Focus Attack, allows him to charge up and release a powerful, armored attack that can absorb one hit. Here are some tips to get the most out of it:\n\n1. **Use it to punish**: Focus Attack is great for punishing opponents who try to attack you while you're charging. Time it correctly, and you'll absorb their hit and counter with a powerful blow.\n2. **Use it to frame trap**: Focus Attack has a lot of frame advantage, making it difficult for opponents to punish you if they block it. Use this to your advantage by canceling into a normal attack or special move, creating a frame trap.\n3. **Use it to bait**: Focus Attack can be used to bait out an opponent's attack, making them think you're vulnerable. When they take the bait, counter with a well-timed Focus Attack.\n4. **Use it to defend**: Focus Attack can absorb one hit, making it a great defensive tool. Use it to defend against an opponent's attack, and then counterattack while they're recovering.\n5. **Cancel into specials**: Focus Attack can be canceled into Ken's special moves, such as his Shoryuken or Gohadoken. This adds to his combo potential and makes him a more formidable opponent.\n\n**General Ken tips**\n\n1. **Master his normals**: Ken's normals, such as his standing medium kick and crouching medium punch, are very strong. Practice using them effectively to control the pace of the match.\n2. **Use his fireballs wisely**: Ken's fireballs are great for zoning and keeping opponents at a distance. However, they can be risky if not used carefully, as they leave you open to punishment.\n3. **Play patiently**: Ken is a character who excels at mid-range combat. Play patiently, focus on controlling the pace, and wait for opportunities to strike.\n4. **Learn to punish**: Ken has a lot of punishing tools, such as his Shoryuken and focus attack. Practice punishing opponents for their mistakes to take advantage of their errors.\n\n**Training mode is your friend**\n\nTo improve your Ken playstyle, spend time in training mode practicing his V-Skill, normals, and specials. Focus on mastering his Focus Attack, and experiment with different cancel routes and combos.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect! The more you play Ken, the more comfortable you'll become with his moveset and playstyle.\n\nGood luck, and have fun playing Street Fighter V with your friends!",
