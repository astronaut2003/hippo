However, I can tell you that it's a highly acclaimed indoor rollercoaster that combines high-speed thrills with immersive theming and special effects.\n\nThe Revenge of the Mummy's ancient Egyptian tomb theme is certainly an unique and exciting concept, and I can imagine it adds an extra layer of excitement to the ride experience. It's great that you got to ride it three times in a row and enjoyed every minute of it!\n\nBy the way, did you know that the Revenge of the Mummy rollercoaster features a launch system that accelerates from 0 to 40 mph in just 2 seconds? That's some serious adrenaline rush right there!\n\nKeep on thrill-seeking and enjoying those rollercoasters!",

I'm happy to help you with information on Disneyland's Halloween events.\n\nEvery year, Disneyland Resort in California celebrates Halloween Time, which typically runs from mid-September to November 1st. During this time, the park is transformed with spooky decorations, themed attractions, and special events.\n\nMickey's Halloween Party is a separate-ticket event that takes place on select nights, usually from mid-September to October 31st. The party offers exclusive experiences, such as:\n\n1. Trick-or-treating at designated locations throughout the park.\n2. Special Halloween-themed fireworks and projections on the castle.\n3. Character meet-and-greets in costume.\n4. Exclusive entertainment, like the \"Frightfully Fun Parade\" and \"Mickey's Trick & Treat\" stage show.\n5. Access to Haunted Mansion Holiday and Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy, which are transformed with Halloween-themed overlays.\n\nAs for this year's events, Disneyland has not officially announced the dates and details for Mickey's Halloween Party. However, based on previous years, it's likely that the party will return in mid-September and run through October.\n\nKeep an eye on the official Disneyland website and social media channels for updates on Halloween Time and Mickey's Halloween Party. They usually announce the dates and ticket information in late summer.\n\nIn the meantime, you can start planning your trip by checking the Disneyland website for general park hours, attraction closures, and special events. You might also consider booking your hotel and making dining reservations in advance, as Halloween Time is a popular season at the Disneyland Resort.\n\nHave a spook-tacular time at Disneyland, and I hope you get to experience Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy again!",
