Despite being young, she is fiercely intelligent and has a strong sense of morality. She is passionate about social justice and uses her voice to advocate for change.\n2. 21-year-old Jake is a college student who is struggling to find his place in the world. He is talented and ambitious, but his insecurities hold him back. He is close with his family and values their support, but he also wants to forge his own path.\n3. 27-year-old Sarah is a successful businesswoman who has climbed the corporate ladder quickly. She is driven and determined, but her focus on her career often comes at the expense of her personal relationships.\n4. 29-year-old Matt is a software developer who is struggling to balance his love for technology with his desire for human connection. He is introspective and sensitive, and he often feels torn between his desire for solitude and his need for companionship.\n5. 42-year-old Rachel is a stay-at-home mother who is struggling to find meaning in her life outside of her role as a caregiver. She is fiercely loyal to her family, but she also feels unfulfilled and yearns for something more.\n6. 73-year-old David is a retired engineer who is grappling with the loss of his wife and the changes that come with aging. He is wise and experienced, but he also feels a sense of loss and regret for opportunities missed.\n\nI hope these character ideas are helpful as you continue to develop your book. Let me know if you have any specific questions or would like further suggestions.",
