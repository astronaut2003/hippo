You'll definitely want to keep your phone charged, especially with all the photo opportunities and map navigation you'll be doing.\n\nRegarding a power adapter for your laptop, it's a good idea to pack one, especially if you plan to stay in your hotel room or work remotely during your trip. While many hotels and cafes do have outlets, it's not always a guarantee, and you don't want to be stuck without a charged laptop.\n\nIn the United States, the standard power outlets are Type A and Type B, which are different from those found in many other countries. So, if your laptop charger is not compatible with these outlets, you'll need a power adapter.\n\nHere are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Universal power adapter**: A universal power adapter can be used in multiple countries and can accommodate different types of outlets. This is a great option if you plan to travel frequently.\n2. **USA-specific power adapter**: If you only need to charge your laptop in the United States, a USA-specific power adapter will work just fine.\n3. **Power bank with built-in adapter**: Some power banks come with built-in adapters, which can be convenient for charging your laptop on the go.\n\nWhen packing your power adapter, make sure to check the following:\n\n* The adapter is compatible with your laptop's power requirements (voltage, wattage, etc.)\n* The adapter has the correct plug type for the United States (Type A and Type B)\n* The adapter is compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry around\n\nAs for outlets at hotels and cafes, you can generally expect to find them available, but it's always a good idea to call ahead or check the hotel's website to confirm. Additionally, some cafes and coffee shops may have limited outlets or require you to purchase something in order to use their outlets.\n\nBy packing a portable charger for your phone and a power adapter for your laptop, you'll be well-prepared to stay connected and productive during your trip to San Francisco!",
