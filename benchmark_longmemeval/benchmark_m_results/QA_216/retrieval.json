For example:\n\n* What are your work hours and responsibilities?\n* What social commitments do you have (e.g., regular meetups, events, family obligations)?\n* Do you have any recurring tasks or activities that you need to fit into your schedule (e.g., exercise, hobbies, self-care)?\n\nAlso, what are your top priorities right now? Are there any deadlines or tasks that are causing you the most stress or anxiety?\n\nLastly, what did you learn from your session with Dr. Smith about setting healthy boundaries?

Please keep in mind that it's essential to respect Jess's privacy and boundaries throughout this process.\n\nHere are a few resources that might be a good starting point:\n\n1. **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: A organization that provides education, support, and advocacy for people affected by mental illness. They have local chapters and support groups across the country.\n2. **Crisis Text Line**: A 24/7 text messaging service that connects individuals with trained crisis counselors. They can provide immediate support and guidance.\n3. **SupportGroups.com**: A website that allows you to search for support groups in your area, covering a wide range of topics and issues.\n4. **Local non-profit organizations**: Many cities have non-profit organizations that focus on specific areas, such as mental health, cancer support, or grief counseling. These organizations often offer support groups, counseling, and resources.\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of what Jess is going through, I can provide more tailored suggestions. Remember to approach the conversation with empathy and respect, and make sure to involve her in the process of finding resources that work best for her.\n\nHow would you like to proceed?",

However, the frequency of your practice may depend on your personal goals, schedule, and level of experience. If you are new to yoga, you may want to start with shorter, less frequent sessions and gradually increase the practice’s length and frequency. Consistency is key, so even if you can only manage a short practice session, try to do it regularly. Remember, yoga is not a competition, and it's essential to listen to your body and practice at your own pace. Consistent yoga practice, coupled with meditation, deep breathing, and other stress reduction techniques, can help alleviate stress and anxiety, promote relaxation, and improve overall well-being.",
