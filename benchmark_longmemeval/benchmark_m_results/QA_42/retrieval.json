      "memory": "Write me the beginning of a script (formatted like a real movie script) for a comedy movie scene, based on the below information:\n\nAndy, a man in his 40s, is the Head of Computing at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He has poor personal hygiene and can often be found making moaning noises while using disabled toilets, despite him having no obvious disability. Andy wears an untidy, stained white shirt. When addressing a group he starts with the words \"Right guys, settle down\".\n\nRoger, a man in his 50s, is a computing teacher working under Andy. He is an intelligent man, with grey hair and a laid back attitude to teaching. His classes are often out of control, while he sits there in despair. He has quiet contempt at the fact that Andy is the head of department, because he knows that he is much more qualified than Andy.\n\nJohn is a 69 year old man working as an exam invigilator. As he is past retirement it is unusual that he is still working, but we suspect it might be because he enjoys making people uncomfortable. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his colleagues.\n\nRuth, a woman in her 40s, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to people in German and they don't understand what she's saying. She is attracted to women and regularly has to deter John's advances.",

Jack is not present at the meeting, so the conversation is between the physiotherapist, cardiologist, social worker, and nutritionist only. Jack is a 61-yr old artist (musician) that has recently had a myocardial infarction and is now in the third week of his rehab at a specialized rehabilitation clinic in Amsterdam. Jack wants to get back to playing on stage, but still has trouble biking around town (low capacity) and is anxious to be alone. For this reason, he keeps spending a lot of time at the local pub and drinks a lot of alcohol which is not helping him in the process. Please write a 5-minute script where each professional addresses Jack's situation from his/her own professional perspective. Use the personal factors stated in the script and add a few specific personal and cultural factors. Include medical information and measurements to make it specific and realistic",

While he's had many ridiculous and hilarious costumes over the years, one stands out as particularly memorable:\n\n**The \"MacGruber\" Costume (Season 7, Episode 6)**\n\nIn the episode \"Costume Contest,\" Michael decides to dress up as MacGyver, but with a twist. He creates a hybrid costume combining MacGyver with MacGruber, the fictional character from the SNL sketches. The result is a getup that's equal parts absurd and magnificent.\n\nThe costume consists of:\n\n* A mullet wig\n* A denim jacket with a plethora of unnecessary pockets and straps\n* A pair of ripped jeans\n* A utility belt with a toy knife, a tape measure, and other random items\n* A mustache that's simultaneously bushy and wispy\n\nMichael is convinced that his costume is a masterpiece, and he spends the entire episode proudly showing it off to his employees. The costume is so ridiculous that it becomes a running joke throughout the episode, with even Michael's most loyal employees struggling to contain their laughter.\n\nThe \"MacGruber\" costume is a testament to Michael's creativity, ego, and complete lack of self-awareness. It's a Halloween costume that's so bad, it's good – and it's become an iconic part of The Office's Halloween legacy.",
