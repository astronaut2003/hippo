The lifespan of LED strips can vary depending on factors like quality, usage, and environmental conditions. However, on average, you can expect:\n\n* **20,000 to 30,000 hours**: This is a typical lifespan for standard LED strips. This means they can last around 10-15 years if used for 8 hours a day.\n* **30,000 to 50,000 hours**: High-quality LED strips can last even longer, up to 20-25 years with moderate use.\n* **50,000 hours or more**: Premium LED strips with advanced materials and designs can last 30 years or more.\n\nKeep in mind that LED strips can also be affected by factors like:\n\n* **Temperature**: High temperatures can reduce the lifespan of LED strips.\n* **Humidity**: Moisture can affect the lifespan and performance of LED strips.\n* **Usage**: Frequent on/off switching or extreme brightness settings can reduce the lifespan of LED strips.\n\nTo ensure you get the most out of your LED strips, make sure to:\n\n* Choose high-quality strips from a reputable manufacturer.\n* Follow the manufacturer's installation and usage guidelines.\n* Keep the strips clean and dry.\n* Avoid extreme temperatures and humidity.\n\nFor under-cabinet lighting, you may want to consider LED strips with a high color rendering index (CRI) to ensure they provide good color accuracy and a warm, inviting glow. Look for strips with a CRI of 80 or higher.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
