      "memory": "**Best Times to Visit Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge:**\n\nTo minimize wait times, consider visiting during these periods:\n\n1. **Early morning:** Arrive at the park early, and head straight to Galaxy's Edge. You'll have a better chance of experiencing shorter wait times for Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance.\n2. **Late evening:** Visit Galaxy's Edge later in the day, around 6-8 pm, when the crowds tend to die down. You might find shorter wait times, especially if you're willing to visit during the last hour of park operation.\n3. **Weekdays:** If possible, plan your visit on a weekday instead of a weekend. You'll generally encounter smaller crowds and shorter wait times.\n4. **Avoid peak seasons:** Steer clear of peak seasons like summer, holidays, and school breaks, when crowds are typically larger.\n\n**Using MaxPass:**\n\nDisney's MaxPass system can be a valuable tool to help you minimize wait times, but it depends on your personal preferences and priorities. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Reserved spot in line:** With MaxPass, you can reserve a spot in line for Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run or Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, which can save you a significant amount of time.\n2. **Mobile ordering:** MaxPass allows you to order food and drinks from your phone, which can be convenient when you're short on time.\n3. **Digital photo downloads:** With MaxPass, you'll receive digital downloads of your PhotoPass photos, which can be a nice souvenir.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Additional cost:** MaxPass requires an additional fee, which might not be justified if you're not planning to use it extensively.\n2. **Limited availability:** MaxPass reservations for Galaxy's Edge attractions can fill up quickly, so you might not be able to get a reservation at a convenient time.\n3. **Time management:** You'll need to plan your day around your MaxPass reservation, which might limit your flexibility.\n\n**Tips for using MaxPass:**\n\n1. **Make reservations as soon as possible:** If you decide to use MaxPass, make your reservations for Galaxy's Edge attractions as soon as possible, as they tend to fill up quickly.\n2. **Choose your attractions wisely:** Prioritize the attractions you want to experience the most, and make MaxPass reservations for those first.\n3. **Monitor wait times:** Keep an eye on wait times for Galaxy's Edge attractions, and adjust your MaxPass reservations accordingly.\n\nUltimately, whether or not to use MaxPass depends on your personal preferences and priorities. If you're willing to pay the extra fee and plan your day around the system, it can be a valuable tool to minimize wait times. However, if you're on a budget or prefer to explore the park without a rigid plan, you might not need MaxPass.",
