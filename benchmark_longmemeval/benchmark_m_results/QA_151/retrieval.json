      "memory": "Budgeting for food and souvenirs in Japan can vary greatly depending on your personal preferences and travel style. However, here are some rough estimates to help you plan:\n\n**Food:**\n\n* Fast food/convenience store meals: ¥500-¥1,000 (≈ $4-9 USD) per meal\n* Mid-range restaurant meals: ¥1,000-¥3,000 (≈ $9-28 USD) per meal\n* High-end restaurant meals: ¥5,000-¥10,000 (≈ $45-90 USD) per meal\n* Snacks and drinks: ¥500-¥1,000 (≈ $4-9 USD) per day\n\nAverage daily food budget: ¥2,000-¥5,000 (≈ $18-45 USD)\n\n**Souvenirs:**\n\n* Small souvenirs (e.g., keychains, postcards): ¥500-¥1,000 (≈ $4-9 USD) each\n* Mid-range souvenirs (e.g., t-shirts, magnets): ¥1,000-¥3,000 (≈ $9-28 USD) each\n* High-end souvenirs (e.g., luxury items, artwork): ¥5,000-¥10,000 (≈ $45-90 USD) each\n\nAverage daily souvenir budget: ¥1,000-¥3,000 (≈ $9-28 USD)\n\n**Other expenses:**\n\n* Transportation: ¥200-¥400 (≈ $2-4 USD) per ride (subway, bus, train)\n* Attractions and entrance fees: ¥500-¥2,000 (≈ $4-18 USD) per person\n* Miscellaneous (sundries, tips, etc.): ¥1,000-¥2,000 (≈ $9-18 USD) per day\n\nAverage daily other expenses budget: ¥2,000-¥5,000 (≈ $18-45 USD)\n\n**Total daily budget:**\n\n* Budget-conscious: ¥5,000-¥10,000 (≈ $45-90 USD) per day\n* Mid-range: ¥8,000-¥15,000 (≈ $72-135 USD) per day\n* Luxury: ¥15,000-¥25,000 (≈ $135-225 USD) per day\n\nFor a 7-day trip, you can estimate:\n\n* Budget-conscious: ¥35,000-¥70,000 (≈ $315-630 USD)\n* Mid-range: ¥56,000-¥105,000 (≈ $504-945 USD)\n* Luxury: ¥105,000-¥175,000 (≈ $945-1,575 USD)\n\nConsidering you've already paid for your flight and accommodation, you can allocate the remaining budget for food, souvenirs, and other expenses.\n\nAs a rough estimate, I'd recommend budgeting at least ¥5,000-¥10,000 (≈ $45-90 USD) per day for food and souvenirs, and ¥2,000-¥5,000 (≈ $18-45 USD) per day for other expenses. This should give you a comfortable amount for exploring Japan without breaking the bank.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just rough estimates, and your actual expenses may vary depending on your personal preferences and exchange rates.",

I'd recommend booking as soon as possible to secure the best price.\n\nIf you're flexible with your travel dates, consider flying on the 10th or 12th, as these seem to be the cheaper options. However, if you prefer to arrive closer to your sister's birthday, the 14th or 16th might be a better option for you.\n\nTo give you more options, I've also searched for business class flights on other airlines:\n\n**Alternative Business Class Fares in March:**\n\n* **ANA (Los Angeles to Tokyo)**: $2,400 - $2,800\n* **American Airlines (Los Angeles to Tokyo)**: $2,600 - $3,200\n* **Delta (Los Angeles to Tokyo)**: $2,800 - $3,400\n\nKeep in mind that these fares may not be exactly on your preferred dates, but they might be worth considering if you're open to flying with other airlines.\n\nWhat would you like to do?
