In this case, since you're writing a review of the City Art Museum's Impressionist Masters exhibition, it's best to focus primarily on that exhibition.\n\nMentioning other art events or exhibitions can be distracting and take away from the main topic of your review. However, if you have a specific point to make about how the Impressionist Masters exhibition compares to another exhibition or event you've attended, it might be worth mentioning.\n\nFor example, if you want to discuss how the Impressionist Masters exhibition's curation was more effective than the Modern Art Gallery tour you attended, or how it sparked a new appreciation for Impressionist art that you didn't have after visiting the Photography Museum exhibition, that could be a relevant and useful comparison.\n\nBut if you're just listing off a series of art events you've attended without any specific insights or connections to the Impressionist Masters exhibition, it might come across as unnecessary or even boastful.\n\nSo, to summarize: if you have a specific point to make or a relevant comparison to draw, go for it! But if you're just listing off a series of art events, it's probably better to focus on the exhibition at hand.",
