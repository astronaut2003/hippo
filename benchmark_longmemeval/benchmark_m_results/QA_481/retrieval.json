Here are some suggestions on how to organize it:\n\n**Option 1: Organize by Type**\n\n* Separate cleaning supplies by type, such as:\n\t+ All-purpose cleaners\n\t+ Glass cleaners\n\t+ Disinfectants\n\t+ Dusters and duster extenders\n\t+ Mops and mop heads\n\t+ Sponges and scrubbers\n\t+ Trash bags and cleaning tools\n\nThis approach is useful if you have a lot of similar products and want to group them together. It's also helpful if you have a large caddy or bucket with multiple compartments.\n\n**Option 2: Organize by Room**\n\n* Separate cleaning supplies by room or area, such as:\n\t+ Kitchen: all-purpose cleaners, dish soap, sink cleaner, etc.\n\t+ Bathrooms: toilet cleaner, shower cleaner, glass cleaner, etc.\n\t+ Living Room: dusting supplies, furniture polish, etc.\n\t+ Bedrooms: laundry supplies, dusting supplies, etc.\n\nThis approach is useful if you have a smaller caddy or bucket and want to carry only the necessary supplies for a specific area. It's also helpful if you have a lot of room-specific cleaning tasks.\n\n**Hybrid Approach**\n\n* Combine both methods by organizing your caddy or bucket into sections, such as:\n\t+ All-purpose cleaners (with separate compartments for kitchen, bathroom, etc.)\n\t+ Disinfectants (with separate compartments for bathroom, kitchen, etc.)\n\t+ Dusters and duster extenders (with separate compartments for living room, bedrooms, etc.)\n\nThis approach gives you the flexibility to group similar products together while still separating them by room or area.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Store frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations, such as the top shelf or in a convenient pocket.\n* Keep heavy items, like bottles of cleaner, at the bottom of the caddy or bucket to prevent them from falling and causing a mess.\n* Consider adding dividers or small bins within the caddy or bucket to separate small items and keep them organized.\n* Make sure to clean and maintain your caddy or bucket regularly to prevent dirt and grime from building up.\n\nBy organizing your cleaning caddy or bucket in a way that makes sense to you, you'll be able to quickly find what you need and make your cleaning routine more efficient.

You can find affordable storage solutions at Target or other home goods stores.\n\n**4. Utilize Vertical Space**:\nMaximize your storage space by using wall-mounted shelves, hooks, or a pegboard to hang items like mops, dusters, and cleaning tools. This will free up floor and counter space.\n\n**5. Keep Frequently Used Items Accessible**:\nStore your most frequently used cleaning supplies in easy-to-reach locations, such as:\n\t* A caddy or bucket with all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants near the sink\n\t* A shelf or hook near the laundry room with laundry supplies\n\n**6.

Store Heavy Items Below**:\nHeavy items like bottles of cleaner or large containers of paper products should be stored on lower shelves or in bins on the floor to prevent them from falling and causing a mess.\n\n**9. Keep it Maintained**:\nSet aside time each week to maintain your organized cleaning supply storage. Restock supplies as needed, and ensure everything is still organized and easily accessible.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to efficiently store your Up & Up cleaning supplies and make the most of your Cartwheel deal.

For example, for a $300,000 home, the annual maintenance cost would be around $3,000. However, this is just an estimate and costs can be higher or lower depending on individual circumstances. It's important to budget for these costs as regular maintenance can save homeowners money in the long run by avoiding costly repairs that may result from neglecting routine upkeep.",
