I think you'll find it a great choice for getting back into reading.\n\nBrené Brown's work is amazing, and \"Daring Greatly\" is a fantastic book. Her TED talks are incredible, and her writing is just as engaging and thought-provoking.

You might consider reaching out to the facilitator or other group members to reconnect, or seeking out new resources that offer similar support.\n\n**Building on Your Progress**\n\nRemember, getting back into your routine and finding ways to take care of yourself is a process. It's okay to take things one step at a time and focus on small, achievable goals.\n\nYou've already made great progress by:\n\n1. Committing to 10-15 minutes of bodyweight exercises, 3 times a week.\n2. Getting back into reading with a goal of finishing \"Wild\" and exploring other books.\n3. Reflecting on the bereavement support group and acknowledging its value.\n\nCelebrate these small wins, and remember that they're all part of your journey towards healing and growth.\n\nHow do you feel about reflecting on your experience with the bereavement support group?

It's clear that the bereavement support group had a positive impact on your life, and it's great that you're acknowledging the specific aspects that worked well for you.\n\n**The Power of Community and Guidance**\n\nYou're right, having a sense of community and guidance can be incredibly powerful in the healing process. Knowing that you're not alone in your grief and having a safe space to express your emotions can be incredibly liberating.\n\nThe facilitator's kindness, understanding, and guidance likely played a significant role in creating a safe and supportive environment.

It's a reminder that you don't have to carry your grief alone and that there are people who care and want to support you.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you mention the value of listening to others without judgment.

While I don't have personal experiences, I can offer some general information and resources on coping with grief and loss.\n\n**Understanding Grief:**\n\nGrief is a natural and unique experience for each person. It's a complex mix of emotions, thoughts, and physical sensations that can affect every aspect of your life. The grieving process can be intense, and it's essential to remember that there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to grieve.\n\n**Coping with Grief:**\n\n1. **Allow yourself to feel your emotions:** It's essential to acknowledge and accept your feelings, even if they're painful or uncomfortable. Avoid suppressing your emotions, as this can prolong the grieving process.\n2. **Take care of your physical health:** Grief can be physically exhausting. Make sure to get enough rest, eat healthily, and engage in regular exercise to help your body cope with the emotional strain.\n3. **Seek social support:** Connecting with others who have experienced a similar loss can be incredibly helpful. Consider joining a bereavement support group, like the one you attended, or talking to friends, family, or a therapist.\n4. **Find healthy ways to express your emotions:** Writing, art, music, or other creative outlets can help you process your feelings. You can also try journaling, talking to a trusted friend or family member, or engaging in a hobby that brings you comfort.\n5. **Create a memorial or ritual:** Developing a personal ritual, such as lighting a candle, visiting a special place, or creating a memory book, can help you honor your loved one and find closure.\n6. **Be patient and kind to yourself:** Grief is a journey, and it takes time. Be gentle with yourself, and avoid putting pressure on yourself to \"get over\" your loss by a certain time.\n7. **Consider professional help:** If your grief feels overwhelming or is interfering with your daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide guidance, support, and coping strategies.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* The American Psychological Association (APA) offers a range of resources on grief and loss, including articles, videos, and podcasts.\n* The National Alliance for Grieving Children provides support and resources for children and adults who have experienced the loss of a loved one.\n* The Dougy Center for Grieving Children & Families offers resources, support groups, and online forums for those who have experienced loss.\n* The Hospice Foundation of America provides information and resources on end-of-life care, grief, and loss.\n\nRemember, grief is a unique and individual experience, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to coping. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this challenging time.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I'm here if you need any further guidance or just someone to talk to.",

I can't recall specific dates of family gatherings or funerals you attended.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to help you recall the dates:\n\n1. Check your digital calendar: If you use a digital calendar like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook, check your past events and appointments. You might find the dates and details of the family gatherings and funerals you attended.\n2. Look through photos and social media: Go through your photo albums, social media posts, and online storage services like Google Photos or iCloud. You might find photos or posts from the events you're trying to remember, which can help you recall the dates.\n3. Ask family members or friends: Reach out to family members or friends who attended the events with you. They might be able to provide you with the dates or details you're looking for.\n4. Check old emails and messages: Search through your email inbox and message threads from the past year. You might find invitations, RSVPs, or follow-up messages related to the events.\n5. Review your paper calendar or planner: If you use a physical calendar or planner, flip through the pages from the past year. You might have written down notes or dates that can help you recall the events.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you recall the dates of the family gatherings and funerals you attended!",

Online forums and social media communities can also be a great way to connect with others who understand what you're going through.\n\n**Journaling as a Therapeutic Outlet**\n\nI love that you mentioned journaling as a therapeutic outlet! Writing can be such a powerful way to process emotions and gain clarity. It's a great way to reflect on your experiences, identify patterns, and work through challenging emotions. Remember, journaling is a judgment-free zone, so feel free to write whatever comes to mind without worrying about grammar, spelling, or coherence.\n\n**Reaching Out to Friends and Family**\n\nReaching out to friends and family members who have gone through similar experiences can be incredibly helpful. Sometimes, all we need is someone to talk to who understands what we're going through. It's wonderful that you're grateful for the support you've received so far, and I'm sure that continuing to reach out to others will only help you heal further.\n\n**Celebrating Small Wins**\n\nRemember to celebrate these small wins, my friend! You're taking proactive steps towards healing and growth, and that's something to be proud of. Don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks or difficult days. Instead, focus on the progress you've made and the steps you're taking towards a brighter future.\n\nKeep in mind that healing is a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You got this!\n\nHow do you feel about starting your journaling practice? Do you have any specific goals or prompts in mind, or do you want to just see where your writing takes you?",
