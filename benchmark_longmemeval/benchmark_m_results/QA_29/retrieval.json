Whisk the eggs well: Make sure to whisk the eggs well until the mixture becomes frothy and the yolks and whites are fully combined.\n\n2. Use a nonstick skillet: A nonstick skillet will help prevent the omelette from sticking and tearing when you fold it. It also helps to cook the eggs evenly.\n\n3. Keep the heat medium-high: Don't cook your omelette over too high or too low heat. Overcooking can cause the omelette to become dry and rubbery. Cook the omelette over medium-high heat to make it fluffy and light.\n\n4. Don't overfill the omelette: Keep the omelette filling light to prevent it from becoming too heavy.\n\n5. Fold the omelette gently: To get the light and fluffy texture, you want to fold the omelette gently, using a spatula. Don't press down too hard, or you could flatten the egg mixture and make it dense.\n\n6. Serve immediately: Serve the omelette immediately after folding to prevent it from getting cold and potentially limp. Enjoy your fluffy and light French omelette!",

      "memory": "- Who doesn't love a tasty meatball recipe? This one is baked in the oven for even browning and easy cleanup and then it's simmered in the best homemade marinara sauce. I love these baked meatballs for an easy dinner recipe but they're also great for meal prep to enjoy later in the week or even months into the future and with how delicious they are, you won't even know that they are gluten free and low carb. So let me show you how to make 'em. Many people inaccurately think that eggs help to add moisture to meatballs but too many eggs can actually make them more dense.\n\n That's why I'm only using one egg as a binder in today's recipe but what does help to make meatballs moist when you're not using a panade of breadcrumbs and milk is chopped onions. You guys have seen how much moisture onions can release when sauteed and they'll help to release some of that moisture into the meatballs as well.\n\nYou'll need one third cup of diced onion for this recipe and I like to dice it pretty finely so that there's no super large chunks and since I chopped half an onion today, I'll save the leftovers to use in my scrambled eggs and to stir fries later this week. In addition to adding moisture, the chopped onion along with a few other ingredients like freshly chopped herbs also helps to prevent the meatballs from becoming too dense.\n\nThink of these ingredients along with Parmesan cheese that we'll add in a bit as ones that create little nooks and crannies of flavor within the meatballs.\n\n I'm using a quarter cup of finely chopped fresh parsley but you could use a combination of other tender herbs as well. So I'll measure that out and set it aside and save the leftover chopped parsley to use later this week. Now, I don't know if it's possible to have an Italian meatball recipe without garlic although I personally think garlic is a requirement in most savory recipes. You guys know I'm a big fan and for this recipe, you'll need three garlic cloves. At this point, you can preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit because we're making baked meatballs today.\n\n You can of course make meatballs in a pan on the stove but baking them is just so darn easy. So let's talk meat For these meatballs.\n\nYou'll need one and a half pounds of ground meat and you can use your favorite whether that's ground beef, ground pork, ground turkey, ground lamb, et cetera, et cetera. I personally like a combination of ground beef and ground pork and I usually go 50/50 or today I grabbed a pound of ground beef and half a pound of ground pork. To that, you'll add one large egg, the one third cup of finely chopped onion, a quarter cup of almond flour, a quarter cup of shredded Parmesan cheese, the quarter cup of chopped parsley, those three garlic cloves which you can mince straight into the bowl, one tablespoon of Italian seasoning, one teaspoon of kosher salt and half a teaspoon of ground black pepper.\n\nMix all of that together with your hands until it's just combined. Do be careful not to overmix it as that will then compact everything and again, contribute to dense meatballs which is what we don't want. Use a medium cookie scoop to scoop out a portion of the meat mixture and then roll it between your hands. I'm using my favorite OXO cookie scoop which you guys have seen me me use on many recipes and I'll link it below. Now, you don't have to use a cookie scoop but I do love that it keeps the meatballs all the same size which means that they cook evenly and it also ensures you'll end up with exactly 30 meatballs which fits perfectly on one sheet pan.\n\nSee, there is a method to my madness when it comes to recipe ratios. Bake the meatballs for about 20 minutes or until they're lightly browned on the outside and just cooked through. I like to cook mine for 18 minutes and then set the top broiler on for the last two minutes so they get nice and browned. And while the meatballs are baking, let's make a homemade marinara sauce.\n\nThere's just five simple ingredients and while yes, it's easy to grab jarred marinara sauce at the store, the flavor of homemade just tastes fresher and fresher always equals better.\n\n The first ingredient is one small onion. Mine is not so small today so my marinara sauce will be a bit more chunky but you can always add as much or as little onion as you'd like and once that's done, add it to a bowl. There are two fresh herbs in this recipe, basil and thyme and together, both will invoke all those lovely Italian flavors that you know and love.\n\nPile several basil leaves on top of each other, roll them together and then either thinly slice them or chop them up. It's up to you on how much texture you'd like in your marinara sauce but I aim for about one tablespoon of chopped basil.\n\n And then for the fresh thyme, remove the leaves from the stem and then roughly chop up about a tablespoon of fresh thyme as well. The last ingredient to prep is four garlic cloves so just peel those and then take everything over to the stove. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a pot over medium high heat and saute the onion for three to four minutes or until it's translucent then add the minced garlic and saute that for another 30 seconds or so until it becomes fragrant.\n\nAdd one 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes along with the chopped thyme and a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt and hold off on adding the basil right now. It's more tender so you'll only stir that in at the very end.\n\n Simmer this for 20 to 25 minutes to let the flavors meld then remove it from the heat and stir in the chopped fresh basil. Now, since I'm gonna use this right away, I'm going to transfer it to my large braiser pan but you can always make this marinara sauce ahead of time and store it and I've got storage details on the full blog post. At this point, the meatballs are now done and when you take them out of the oven, you'll notice that they've oozed a bit. This is totally normal and it's just some of that fat seeping out but that falls right off as soon as you pick them up and if you cut into one of them, you'll see that even without breadcrumbs, they've got a wonderful texture that's not too dense and they're beautifully golden on the outside.\n\nOf course, you can enjoy these meatballs with a variety of sauces including a romesco sauce or even a chimichurri sauce but if you wanna serve them up in a marinara sauce, you can just plop the meatballs into the pan, roll them around in the sauce and then simmer the pan on low to keep them warmed through.\n\n Before serving, you can sprinkle some fresh parsley for a pop of green and I love to eat these over some spiralized zucchini noodles but you can also serve them up as an appetizer and just stick a toothpick in each one for the perfect bite size snack.\n\nThese meteor meatballs are loaded with flavor, nice and moist without the use of bread and a staple meal prep recipe in my kitchen. I hope you guys enjoyed today's video and if you did, make sure to hit that thumbs up button, share the recipe with your family and friends and I will see you again in the next video. (calm music).",

      "memory": "Nutritional deficiencies can be a common culprit behind decreased egg production. Let's dive deeper into the ideal feed composition for laying hens:\n\n**Macronutrients:**\n\n1. **Protein:** Laying hens require a diet rich in protein to produce eggs. Aim for a feed with 16-18% protein on a dry matter basis. Protein sources can include:\n\t* Plant-based proteins: soybean meal, corn gluten meal, and wheat gluten\n\t* Animal-based proteins: fish meal, meat and bone meal, and feather meal\n2. **Energy (Fat and Carbohydrates):** Hens need energy to maintain body weight, produce eggs, and regulate body temperature. Aim for a feed with:\n\t* 2-3% fat (from sources like soybean oil, corn oil, or sunflower oil)\n\t* 40-50% carbohydrates (from sources like corn, wheat, oats, and barley)\n3. **Fiber:** A moderate amount of fiber is essential for digestive health and nutrient absorption. Aim for 2-4% fiber in the feed.\n\n**Micronutrients:**\n\n1. **Calcium:** Crucial for strong eggshell production, calcium should be present at 3-4% of the feed on a dry matter basis. Sources include limestone, oyster shells, and dark leafy greens.\n2. **Phosphorus:** Essential for egg production, phosphorus should be present at 0.5-1% of the feed. Sources include dicalcium phosphate, monocalcium phosphate, and bone meal.\n3. **Vitamins and Minerals:**\n\t* Vitamin A: important for egg production, vision, and immune function\n\t* Vitamin D: crucial for calcium absorption and bone health\n\t* Vitamin E: antioxidant properties support overall health\n\t* Vitamin K: involved in blood clotting and bone health\n\t* Minerals like potassium, magnesium, and manganese support various bodily functions\n\n**Other Essential Nutrients:**\n\n1. **Amino Acids:** Ensure the feed contains a balanced mix of essential and non-essential amino acids, which are crucial for protein synthesis and egg production.\n2. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** These anti-inflammatory fatty acids support overall health and can be found in sources like flaxseed, chia seeds, and fish oil.\n\n**Feed Types:**\n\n1. **Laying Pellets or Crumbles:** These are the most common type of feed, providing a balanced mix of nutrients in a convenient, easy-to-eat form.\n2. **Layer Mash:** A loose, unprocessed feed that requires more work from the hens to eat, which can help reduce boredom and stimulate foraging behavior.\n3. **Grains and Grains Plus:** Whole grains like oats, barley, and corn can be offered as a supplement or as a treat, but should not make up more than 10-15% of the total diet.\n\n**Tips and Considerations:**\n\n1. **Avoid Fillers:** Opt for feeds with minimal or no fillers like wheat middlings, brewers' dried yeast, or other by-products.\n2. **Watch for Allergens:** If you have hens with allergies or sensitivities, choose feeds with alternative protein sources or hypoallergenic ingredients.\n3. **Consider Age and Breed:** Different breeds and age groups (e.g., pullets, layers, or seniors) have varying nutritional needs. Ensure your feed is formulated specifically for your flock's stage of life and breed characteristics.\n4. **Fresh Water:** Always provide access to fresh, clean water to ensure optimal nutrient absorption and overall health.\n\nWhen selecting a feed, look for products from reputable manufacturers that meet the above guidelines. You can also consult with a veterinarian or poultry expert to determine the best feed for your specific flock.",

      "memory": "You're on the right track! Revisiting your flock's diet and making adjustments can make a significant difference in their health and egg production.\n\nAdding supplements like oyster shells or dark leafy greens can be an excellent way to ensure your hens are getting enough calcium. Here's why:\n\n1. **Oyster Shells:** Oyster shells are an excellent source of calcium carbonate, which is essential for strong eggshell production. Crushed oyster shells can be offered free-choice, meaning hens can eat as much or as little as they need. This allows them to regulate their own calcium intake. Aim for about 1-2 cups of oyster shells per 10 hens per week.\n2. **Dark Leafy Greens:** Dark leafy greens like kale, spinach, and collard greens are rich in calcium, vitamins, and minerals. They can be offered as a treat or added to their regular feed. These greens are also rich in antioxidants and can help support overall health.\n\nOther supplements you might consider adding to their diet:\n\n1. **Calcium-rich fruits and vegetables:** Offer fruits like strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries, and vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, or carrots, which are all rich in calcium.\n2. **Grit:** Grit, like crushed eggshells or small rocks, helps hens digest their food and can also provide additional calcium.\n3. **Probiotics:** Probiotics can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is essential for nutrient absorption and overall health.\n\nWhen adding supplements, remember:\n\n1. **Start slow:** Introduce new supplements gradually to prevent digestive upset.\n2. **Monitor intake:** Observe your hens' behavior and adjust the amount of supplements based on their individual needs.\n3. **Balance is key:** Ensure that supplements don't overpower their regular feed. Aim for a balanced diet with a mix of nutrients.\n\nBefore making any significant changes, consider the following:\n\n1. **Consult with a veterinarian:** If you're unsure about your flock's specific needs or have concerns about their health, consult with a veterinarian or poultry expert for personalized advice.\n2. **Review the feed label:** Check the label of your current layer pellet to see if it's providing adequate calcium and other essential nutrients. You might be surprised to find that it's already meeting their needs.\n\nBy making informed adjustments to their diet, you can help ensure your hens are getting the nutrients they need to thrive and produce healthy, delicious eggs!",
