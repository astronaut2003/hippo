      "memory": "Som Tam is a fantastic appetizer for a dinner party, and it's great that you're thinking about pairing it with a main course that complements its bold flavors. Here are some main course suggestions that would pair well with the spicy and sour flavors of Som Tam:\n\n1. **Grilled Fish with Thai Herbs**: A delicate fish like tilapia, cod, or snapper, marinated in a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, garlic, and Thai herbs like lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves, would pair beautifully with Som Tam. The herbal flavors will complement the freshness of the papaya, while the grilled fish will provide a nice textural contrast.\n2. **Massaman Curry with Beef or Chicken**: A rich and slightly sweet Massaman curry with beef or chicken will provide a nice contrast to the bright, sour flavors of Som Tam. The curry's spices, like cinnamon, cardamom, and star anise, will also complement the warm, aromatic flavors of the papaya salad.\n3. **Stir-Fried Pork or Chicken with Basil and Chilies**: A quick stir-fry with pork or chicken, Thai basil, chilies, garlic, and a squeeze of lime juice will tie in nicely with the spicy and sour flavors of Som Tam. This dish will also add a nice pop of color to your dinner table.\n4. **Thai-Style BBQ Pork or Chicken with Sticky Rice**: Slow-cooked pork or chicken in a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce, served with sticky rice, will provide a nice balance to the bright, zesty flavors of Som Tam. The sweetness of the BBQ sauce will also help to calm down the heat from the chilies.\n5. **Pan-Seared Duck Breast with Tamarind Glaze**: For a more luxurious option, a pan-seared duck breast with a sweet and sour tamarind glaze will pair beautifully with Som Tam. The duck's richness will be balanced by the bright, sour flavors of the papaya salad, while the tamarind glaze will add a nice depth of flavor.\n\nThese are just a few ideas, but ultimately, the choice of main course will depend on your personal preferences and the flavor profiles you enjoy. You can't go wrong with a classic Thai dish like Pad Thai or Green Curry, but if you want to offer something a bit more unique, these options should provide a great starting point.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your dinner party will be a hit!",

Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Som Tam (Papaya Salad) Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 large, green papaya (about 1 lb), peeled and grated (see notes)\n* 2 cups mixed tomatoes, diced ( cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, and/or heirloom tomatoes)\n* 1/2 cup chilies, seeded and minced ( Thai bird's eye chilies or similar)\n* 1/2 cup peanuts, roasted and chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1/4 cup fermented fish sauce ( nam pla or similar)\n* 2 tbsp palm sugar (or brown sugar)\n* 2 tbsp lime juice\n* Salt, to taste\n* 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n* Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (optional)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Green papaya can be found in some Asian markets or online. If you can't find it, you can substitute with a firm, green mango or a mixture of green apples and pears.\n* Adjust the level of spiciness to your liking by using more or fewer chilies.\n* Fermented fish sauce (nam pla) is a key ingredient in Som Tam. You can find it in Asian markets or online. If you can't find it, you can substitute with a mixture of fish sauce and lime juice.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large mortar and pestle, combine the grated papaya, diced tomatoes, minced chilies, chopped peanuts, and minced garlic.\n2. Pound the ingredients together using the pestle until they're well combined and the papaya starts to break down.\n3. Add the fermented fish sauce, palm sugar, lime juice, and salt. Mix well.\n4. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more chilies, fish sauce, lime juice, or sugar to taste.\n5. Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and drizzle with vegetable oil.\n6. Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves, if desired.\n7. Serve immediately, as Som Tam is best consumed fresh.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a mortar and pestle to bruise the ingredients and release their flavors. If you don't have one, you can use a food processor or blender, but be careful not to over-process.\n* Be gentle when pounding the papaya, as it can become mushy quickly.\n* Som Tam is a flexible recipe, so feel free to adjust the ingredients to your taste. You can add or subtract ingredients like dried shrimp, carrots, or chayote squash to make it your own.\n\nNow, go ahead and give Som Tam a try!",
