Pop Art emerged in the United States in the 1950s as a response to the consumer culture of the time. Artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein turned to everyday objects and images from popular culture (like comic books, advertisements, and consumer products) as inspiration for their work. By elevating these objects into the realm of art, they challenged traditional notions of what art could and should be. Abstract Expressionism was also an American movement that emerged after World War II. Artists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko emphasized spontaneous, unstructured painting that emphasized the artist's emotions and movements. This approach was seen as a revolt against traditional approaches to painting, which had emphasized realism and objective representation. These movements had a significant impact on the larger art world and continue to influence artists today. I hope you find these resources helpful in learning more about them!",

The scenario you described, including the exhibition and the artist Sarah Johnson, is fictional.\n\nBut don't worry! I can still provide you with some general recommendations on how to discover emerging artists and exhibitions in the contemporary art scene:\n\n1. **Online Art Platforms**: Websites like Artsy, Artnet, and Hyperallergic feature news, reviews, and articles about contemporary art, including emerging artists and exhibitions.\n2. **Social Media**: Follow art critics, curators, galleries, and art organizations on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. They often share updates about new exhibitions, artists, and trends.\n3. **Art Fairs and Biennales**: Attend art fairs like Art Basel, Frieze, and biennales like the Venice Biennale or the Whitney Biennial, which showcase works by emerging and established artists.\n4. **Local Art Scene**: Explore local art galleries, museums, and art schools in your area, as they often feature emerging artists and experimental works.\n5. **Art Magazines**: Read publications like Artforum, Art in America, and Frieze Magazine, which provide in-depth coverage of the contemporary art scene.\n6. **Artist-Run Initiatives**: Look for artist-run spaces, collectives, and cooperatives, which often showcase experimental and innovative works by emerging artists.\n\nSome notable emerging artists working on environmental and climate-related themes include:\n\n* **Marina DeBris**: Known for her sculptures and installations that address plastic pollution and marine debris.\n* **Justin Brice Guariglia**: A visual artist and scientist who explores the intersection of art, science, and climate change.\n* **Mary Mattingly**: A multimedia artist who creates installations and performances that focus on environmental issues, such as climate change and sustainability.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just a few examples, and there are many more talented emerging artists working on similar themes.
