Please provide the following information:\n\n1. How much did the service on February 10th cost?\n2. How often do you fill up on fuel, and approximately how much do you spend each time?\n3. Do you have a fixed insurance premium, and if so, how much is it?\n4. How much do you spend on registration and licensing annually or bi-annually?\n5. Do you have any outstanding parking or toll expenses?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a more detailed budget for your car expenses.",
