These two year periods are labeled in order, with the 115th Congress occuring in the years 2017-2018.\n\nResearchers at UM's School of Information collected Twitter posts from sitting MoCs (we'll abbreviate \"member of Congress\" as MoC) during this period and coded them as being original statements or rewteets of other users' submissions. We will focus on the retweet data. These published data include not only the text of the retweet but also information on the member of Congress and the account of the original tweet.\n#python:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sb\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport os\nfrom pandas.plotting import register\\_matplotlib\\_converters\nregister\\_matplotlib\\_converters()\n​\npd.options.mode.chained\\_assignment = None\n\n# In the following we will load the data, though for reasons of speed we will exclude the text of the tweets themselves.\n\ntweets = pd.read\\_csv(os.path.join(base, \"retweets\\_congress\\_115th.csv.gz\"), \n usecols = lambda x: x != \"full\\_text\",\n dtype = {\"tweet\\_id\\_str\": \"str\"},\n index\\_col = \"tweet\\_id\\_str\")\ntweets.shape\nout: (209856, 21)\n\ntweets.columns\nout:Index(['user\\_id\\_str', 'user\\_screen\\_name', 'user\\_followers\\_count', 'created\\_at',\n 'retweet\\_count', 'retweeted\\_status', 'year', 'bioguide', 'birthday',\n 'gender', 'name', 'state', 'chamber', 'party', 'region', 'rt\\_user\\_id',\n 'rt\\_screen\\_name', 'rt\\_followers\\_count', 'rt\\_bio', 'age', 'age\\_bucket'],\n dtype='object')\n\nPart (a)\nCongress is largely composed of two parties (Democrats and Republicans), with a few independents. Which party is responsible for most of the retweets?\n\nCompute the marginal probability of the party of the tweet and save the result to party\\_marg. Display this result.\n​\nPart (b)\nOne question we might ask is, \"How often do Congress members retweet each other?\"\n\nCreate a new column called \"is\\_congress\\_retweet\" that will indicate if the retweet is coming from a MoC. First get the set of unique \"user\\_id\\_str\" values using the .unique() method. Then using that set of ids, use the .isin(values) method on the \"rt\\_user\\_id\" column to create the new boolean column \"is\\_congress\\_retweet\".\n\nFind the marginal probability of retweeting a MoC and save the result to \"congress\\_retweet\\_marg\". Display these results. Is it more common to retweet a member of Congress or from outside of Congress?",

The e-book edition has a varying page count depending on the device and font size, but it's approximately 432-448 pages as well.\n\n**Reading time:**\nWhile page count can give you an idea of the book's length, reading time is a more subjective measure. However, based on average reading speeds, here's a rough estimate:\n\n* Average reading speed: 200-250 words per minute (wpm)\n* Total words in \"The Four Winds\": approximately 140,000 words\n* Estimated reading time: 14-17 hours\n\nAssuming you read for about 1-2 hours a day, you can finish the book in around 7-10 days. However, this is just a rough estimate, and your actual reading time may vary depending on your reading speed, reading habits, and personal schedule.\n\n**Is it a quick read?**\nWhile \"The Four Winds\" is a longer book, Kristin Hannah's writing is engaging, and the story is well-paced. The novel is divided into four parts, each with its own distinct narrative arc, which helps to break up the story and make it feel more manageable.\n\nHannah's writing is also known for being descriptive and immersive, which can make the reading experience feel more like a journey than a chore. If you're invested in the story and characters, you might find yourself devouring the book quickly, despite its length.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for a quick, light read, \"The Four Winds\" might not be the best fit. The book deals with heavy themes, such as poverty, loss, and struggle, which can be emotionally taxing. You might want to set aside dedicated time to read and process the story.\n\nOverall, while \"The Four Winds\" is a longer book, it's a worthwhile investment of your time. Kristin Hannah's writing is captivating, and the story is both heart-wrenching and uplifting.",
