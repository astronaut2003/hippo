A spreadsheet is a great way to keep track of your rewards, but there are other options you might find more convenient:\n\n1. **Loyalty card apps:** Apps like Stocard, Loyalty Card Manager, or Reward Card allow you to store your loyalty cards digitally and track your points. You can also receive notifications when you're near a participating store or when your points are about to expire.\n2. **Digital wallets:** Many digital wallets, such as Apple Wallet or Google Pay, allow you to add loyalty cards and track your rewards.\n3. **Browser extensions:** Browser extensions like Loyalty Checker or Rewards Keeper can help you track your rewards points and alert you to expiring points or special offers.\n4. **Physical card holders:** If you prefer a physical solution, consider a loyalty card holder or a small binder to keep your cards organized. You can also attach a small notebook to keep track of your points and expiration dates.\n5. **Reward tracking websites:** Websites like AwardWallet or TravelBank allow you to track your rewards points across multiple loyalty programs, including credit cards, airlines, and hotels.\n\nExperiment with different methods to find the one that works best for you. You might also consider setting reminders for when your points are about to expire or when you need to earn a certain number of points to reach a reward level.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that you're comfortable with and can easily maintain.
