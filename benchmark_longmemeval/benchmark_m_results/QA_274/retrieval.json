      "memory": "Great choice! Teva and Merrell are both excellent brands for sandals.\n\nAnd oh no, sneaker storage can be a challenge! Keeping them under the bed can indeed cause them to smell, especially if they're made of materials that absorb moisture. Here are some tips to help you store and care for your old sneakers:\n\n1. **Air them out**: Take your sneakers out of storage and let them air out for a few hours. This will help remove any trapped moisture and reduce odors.\n2. **Use shoe trees or stuffing**: Fill the shoes with paper towels, newspaper, or shoe trees to maintain their shape and absorb any moisture. This will prevent creasing and reduce odors.\n3. **Store them in a breathable bag**: Instead of storing them in a sealed plastic bag, use a breathable bag or a cloth bag with holes to allow air to circulate. You can also use a mesh bag or a sneaker storage bag with ventilation.\n4. **Keep them away from direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade and materials to degrade. Store your sneakers in a shaded area or use a UV-resistant storage bag.\n5. **Clean them before storage**: Give your sneakers a good cleaning before storing them. This will remove dirt and debris that can cause odors. Use a gentle cleaning product and a soft brush to clean the exterior, and let them air dry.\n6. **Use odor-controlling products**: You can use odor-controlling products like baking soda, silica gel packets, or shoe deodorizers to absorb moisture and reduce odors.\n7. **Consider a shoe storage box**: If you have limited space, consider investing in a shoe storage box or a sneaker organizer. These can keep your shoes organized, protected, and ventilated.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your sneakers fresh and odor-free. Happy storing!",

However, I can offer some tips to help you find a reliable and skilled cobbler:\n\n1. **Ask around**: Ask friends, family, or coworkers who have similar taste in shoes for recommendations. They might have a trusted cobbler they can refer you to.\n2. **Online reviews**: Check online review platforms like Yelp, Google Reviews, or Facebook Reviews to find cobblers in your area.

Some cobblers might specialize in specific types of shoes or materials.\n5. **Visit in person**: Before leaving your sneakers with a cobbler, visit their shop to get a sense of their work environment, equipment, and customer service. A clean and organized shop is often a good sign.\n\nWhen you find a cobbler you're comfortable with, make sure to ask them about their process, materials, and pricing. A good cobbler will be happy to explain their methods and provide guidance on how to care for your shoes.\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider using online shoe repair services that offer mail-in or drop-off options.

It's amazing how easy it is to accumulate shoes over time, and before you know it, you've got a collection that's bursting out of your closet.\n\nGoing through your shoes and decluttering can be a therapeutic process. You'll get to:\n\n1. **Reassess your style**: Take a closer look at your shoes and see what styles, colors, and brands you're drawn to. This can help you identify patterns and make more intentional purchasing decisions in the future.\n2. **Let go of duplicates**: If you have multiple pairs of similar shoes, consider letting go of the ones that don't bring you joy or serve a specific purpose.\n3. **Identify shoes that need repair**: You might find shoes that need a good cleaning, polishing, or repair. This is a great opportunity to get them fixed or consider donating them to someone who can give them a new life.\n4. **Discover hidden gems**: You might stumble upon shoes that you forgot you had or haven't worn in ages. You might rediscover a favorite pair or find a new favorite!\n5. **Make space**: By decluttering your shoe collection, you'll create space in your closet for new shoes (if you need them) or other items that bring you joy.\n\nAs you go through your shoes, ask yourself:\n\n* When was the last time I wore these shoes?\n* Do they fit comfortably?\n* Are they in good condition?\n* Do they make me feel confident and happy?\n* Can I replace them if I need them again in the future?\n\nBe honest with yourself, and don't be afraid to let go of shoes that no longer serve you. You can donate, sell, or repurpose them to reduce waste and make a positive impact.\n\nRemember, decluttering your shoe collection is not just about getting rid of shoes; it's about creating space, reducing stress, and making room for new experiences and opportunities. Good luck, and have fun!",

This will increase their appeal and value to the thrift store.\n2. **Check the condition**: Ensure your shoes are in good condition, with no broken heels, torn seams, or missing parts. If they're still in excellent shape, they'll be more likely to be accepted by the thrift store.\n3. **Remove any personal items**: Take out any personal items like shoe trees, insoles, or shoe horns, and consider donating them separately or repurposing them.\n\nRemember to ask the thrift store about their donation guidelines and any specific requirements they may have.

However, it's always a good idea to:\n\n1. **Call ahead**: Reach out to the thrift store beforehand to confirm their acceptance of used shoes and ask about any specific guidelines or restrictions.\n2. **Check their website**: Many charity thrift stores have websites or social media pages that outline their donation guidelines and accepted items.\n\nRemember, even if your dress shoes are not accepted, you can consider other options, such as:\n\n1. **Repurposing**: Get creative and find a new use for your old shoes, like using them as planters or decorative items.\n2. **Recycling**: Some shoe companies offer recycling programs for old shoes. You can search online for \"shoe recycling near me\" to find a local drop-off location.\n3. **Donating to a different organization**: There might be other local organizations, such as shelters or non-profit groups, that accept used shoes.\n\nBy donating your gently used dress shoes, you'll be helping those in need and supporting a good cause. Kudos to you for taking the initiative!",

By the way, I was thinking of buying a new pair of jeans from Madewell - I've been eyeing their new summer collection and I think I'll pick up a few pieces. I've also been wanting to try out their personalized denim service where they embroider your name or initials on the jeans. That would make for a really cool and unique gift for my sister's birthday which is coming up in July.",
