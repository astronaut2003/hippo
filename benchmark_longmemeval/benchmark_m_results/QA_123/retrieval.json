      "memory": "South Korea is a country that implemented successful education policies that led to economic growth. In the 1960s, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world, but it transformed itself into one of the most prosperous nations by the late 20th century. One of the key factors in this transformation was the country's emphasis on education. \n\nSouth Korea invested heavily in education and created policies that made it accessible to almost everyone. They introduced free compulsory education for six years, and then expanded it to nine years. They also invested in higher education and made it possible for more students to attend university. \n\nThese policies paid off as South Korea's literacy rate rose from about 20% in the 1940s to almost 100% in 2000. This increase in education led to an increase in talent and innovation. South Korea is now known for its highly skilled workforce, and companies like Samsung and LG are global leaders in electronics and technology.\n\nOverall, South Korea's successful education policies played a critical role in its economic growth, making it an excellent example of how such policies can be effective.",
