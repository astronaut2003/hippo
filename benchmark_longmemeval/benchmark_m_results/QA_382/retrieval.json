They want to know that you'll return to your home country after your temporary work assignment or that you'll follow the proper procedures to adjust your status if you decide to stay longer.\n\n**Tips for Answering**\n\nWhen asked about your long-term plans, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Be Honest**: Acknowledge that you're not sure about your long-term plans, but emphasize your commitment to the job offer and your employer.\n2. **Focus on the Present**: Emphasize your enthusiasm for the job opportunity and your desire to contribute to the company's success during your initial assignment.\n3. **Show Flexibility**: Indicate that you're open to exploring future opportunities in the United States, but you're not making any long-term commitments at this stage.\n4. **Highlight Your Skills**: Emphasize the skills and expertise you bring to the company and how they will benefit from your work.\n\n**Example Answer**\n\nHere's an example answer to help you prepare:\n\n\"I'm excited about the opportunity to work with [Company Name] and contribute my skills and experience to the team. While I'm not sure about my long-term plans, I'm committed to fulfilling my obligations under the EB-2 visa and making a positive impact during my initial assignment. I'm open to exploring future opportunities in the United States, but my primary focus is on delivering exceptional results for the company during my time here. I believe my skills and expertise will be a valuable asset to the company, and I'm eager to get started.\"\n\n**Remember**\n\nIt's essential to be truthful and transparent about your intentions while also demonstrating your commitment to the job offer and your employer. Avoid making any false claims or misrepresenting your intentions, as this could lead to issues with your visa application.",
