Here are some tips to help you choose a great photo to pair with the ticket stub:\n\n**Photo Selection:**\n\n1. **Capture the moment**: Choose a photo that captures the excitement and joy of the concert experience. A photo of you and your sister smiling, laughing, or singing along to Billie Eilish's songs would be perfect.\n2. **Good lighting**: Opt for a photo with good lighting that shows your faces clearly. Avoid photos with harsh shadows or excessive flash.\n3. **Clear faces**: Ensure that your faces are clear and recognizable in the photo. A photo where you're both looking directly at the camera is ideal.\n4. **Concert atmosphere**: Select a photo that captures the concert atmosphere, such as a photo with the stage, crowd, or venue in the background.\n5. **Memorable moment**: Choose a photo that commemorates a special moment from the concert, like when Billie Eilish performed your favorite song or when you and your sister were dancing together.\n\n**Photo Editing:**\n\n1. **Crop and resize**: Crop the photo to focus attention on you and your sister, and resize it to fit the frame comfortably.\n2. **Adjust brightness and contrast**: Adjust the brightness and contrast to ensure the photo looks clear and vibrant.\n3. **Remove distractions**: Remove any distractions from the photo, like people in the background or unwanted objects.\n\n**Framing Considerations:**\n\n1. **Matting**: Consider using a mat with a subtle color that complements the photo and ticket stub.\n2. **Frame style**: Choose a frame style that complements the photo and ticket stub. A simple, sleek frame or a more ornate frame with a music-themed design could work well.\n3. **Layout**: Experiment with different layouts to find the best arrangement for the photo and ticket stub. You could place the photo above or below the ticket stub, or create a collage with both items.\n\n**Tips for Printing:**\n\n1. **High-quality print**: Print the photo on high-quality paper or cardstock to ensure it looks vibrant and clear.\n2. **Size**: Print the photo to a size that fits comfortably within the frame, leaving enough space for the ticket stub.\n3. **Color or black and white**: Consider printing the photo in black and white to add a timeless, nostalgic feel to the display.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a beautiful display that showcases your special concert memory with your sister.
