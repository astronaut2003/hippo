However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't know you went to Universal Studios Hollywood three weeks ago. But I'd be happy to help you with your question about Six Flags Magic Mountain ticket options!\n\nSix Flags Magic Mountain offers various ticket options to cater to different needs and budgets. Here's a breakdown of the most common options:\n\n1. **General Admission**: This is the standard ticket option, which grants access to the park for one day. Prices vary depending on the day of the week, season, and how far in advance you buy the ticket.\n2. **Season Pass**: If you plan to visit Six Flags Magic Mountain multiple times within a year, a season pass might be the best option. It includes admission to the park for the entire operating season, along with some perks like free parking and discounts on food and merchandise.\n3. **One-Day Parking**: If you don't want to commit to a season pass, you can add parking to your general admission ticket for an additional fee.\n4. **Fast Lane**: This option allows you to skip the regular lines for most attractions and shows. You can add Fast Lane to your general admission ticket or buy it as a standalone upgrade.\n5. **VIP Tour**: For a more luxurious experience, consider purchasing a VIP tour, which includes perks like front-of-the-line access, a personal tour guide, and reserved seating at shows.\n6. **Meal Deals**: You can add a meal deal to your ticket, which includes a meal voucher redeemable at participating restaurants within the park.\n7. **Special Offers**: Keep an eye on the Six Flags Magic Mountain website for special promotions, discounts, or bundle deals that might be available during your planned visit.\n\nBefore making a decision, consider the following factors:\n\n* How many days do you plan to visit the park?\n* Are you willing to pay extra for perks like Fast Lane or VIP treatment?\n* Do you want to include parking or meals in your ticket?\n* Are there any special events or festivals happening during your planned visit that might affect ticket prices?\n\nOnce you've weighed your options, you can purchase tickets online through the Six Flags Magic Mountain website or at the park's ticket booths.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision for your Six Flags Magic Mountain trip!",
