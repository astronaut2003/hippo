      "memory": "What a great idea! Air Fryer sweet potato fries are a fantastic side dish that pairs well with many of the meals I mentioned earlier. Here are some tips to help you achieve crispy and delicious sweet potato fries in your Air Fryer:\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. **Choose the right sweet potatoes**: Look for sweet potatoes that are high in starch, like Russet or Idaho potatoes, as they will yield a crisper exterior.\n2. **Cut the sweet potatoes correctly**: Cut the sweet potatoes into long, thin strips, about 1/2 inch thick (1 cm). Try to make the cuts as uniform as possible so that they cook evenly.\n3. **Soak the sweet potato strips**: To remove excess starch and help the fries become crisper, soak the cut sweet potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes. After soaking, pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.\n\n**Air Fryer Settings:**\n\n1. **Temperature**: Set the Air Fryer to 400°F (200°C).\n2. **Cooking time**: Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your sweet potato strips and your desired level of crispiness. As a general guideline, cook for 12-15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.\n3. **Shake the basket**: Halfway through the cooking time, shake the basket to redistribute the fries and ensure even cooking.\n\n**Tips for Crispy Fries:**\n\n1. **Don't overcrowd the basket**: Cook the sweet potato fries in batches if necessary, to ensure they have enough room to cook evenly. Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of crisping.\n2. **Use a small amount of oil**: You can lightly spray the sweet potato fries with oil (e.g., avocado oil or cooking spray) before cooking, but be cautious not to over-oil, as this can prevent crisping.\n3. **Don't open the Air Fryer too often**: Resist the temptation to check on the fries too frequently, as this can release heat and affect the crisping process.\n4. **Season after cooking**: Season the sweet potato fries with salt and any other desired seasonings after cooking, as the heat can cause seasonings to burn or lose flavor.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Experiment with seasonings**: Try different seasoning combinations, such as paprika, garlic powder, or chili powder, to add flavor to your sweet potato fries.\n2. **Keep an eye on the fries**: Monitor the fries during the cooking process, and adjust the cooking time or temperature as needed to achieve your desired level of crispiness.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve deliciously crispy sweet potato fries in your Air Fryer. Enjoy them with your bean- or lentil-based meals!",

Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Korean-Style Fried Chicken Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the marinade:\n\n* 2 lbs chicken pieces ( legs, thighs, wings, breasts, or a combination)\n* 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon Gochujang (Korean chili paste)\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon brown sugar\n* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n* 1 teaspoon Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 1/4 cup water\n* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\nFor the coating:\n\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup cornstarch\n* 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs\n* 1/4 cup potato starch\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1/4 teaspoon Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Marinate the chicken:** In a large bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients. Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n2. **Prepare the coating:** In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, cornstarch, panko breadcrumbs, potato starch, salt, black pepper, and Korean chili flakes.\n3. **Double-fry the chicken:** Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Dredge the chicken pieces in the coating mixture, shaking off excess.\n\t* **First fry:** Heat 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or a deep fryer to 350°F. Fry the chicken in batches until golden brown, about 5-6 minutes. Drain on paper towels.\n\t* **Second fry:** Increase the oil temperature to 375°F. Fry the chicken again in batches until crispy and golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Drain on paper towels.\n4. **Season and serve:** Toss the fried chicken with additional Korean chili flakes and salt to taste. Serve hot with a side of pickled radish, kimchi, or a simple salad.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* For an extra crispy coating, you can chill the coated chicken in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before frying.\n* If you can't find Korean chili flakes, you can substitute with a mixture of cayenne pepper and paprika.\n* For a spicy kick, increase the amount of Korean chili flakes in the marinade and coating.\n* Experiment with different seasonings, such as garlic, ginger, or sesame oil, to create your own flavor profile.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Korean-Style Fried Chicken!",
