These events are led by museum curators, art historians, and local experts, and they're a great way to learn more about the art, artists, and historical context.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n* **Guided Tours**: The museum is offering daily guided tours, which are free with admission to the exhibition. The tours are approximately 45 minutes long and provide an overview of the exhibition. You can check the museum's website or visit the information desk to find out the tour schedule and reserve a spot.\n* **Lectures**: The museum is also hosting a series of lectures, which are free and open to the public. The lectures will explore specific themes and topics related to the exhibition, such as the history of impressionism, the role of women in impressionist art, and the techniques and inspirations of the artists. You can register for the lectures in advance through the museum's website, and seating is limited, so it's recommended to sign up early.\n* **Special Events**: The museum is also hosting some special events, such as a curator's talk, a panel discussion, and a family day with art activities. These events may require registration or have limited seating, so be sure to check the museum's website for details.\n\nIt's worth noting that the museum offers free admission on Thursdays from 5 pm to 8 pm, which is a great opportunity to attend a lecture or guided tour without additional cost.\n\nI recommend checking the City Museum's website or contacting them directly to confirm the schedule, registration, and availability for the guided tours and lectures. You can also follow them on social media to stay up-to-date on any changes or additions to the event schedule.\n\nHave fun planning your visit to the Impressionist Masters Exhibition and the Spring Art Festival!",
