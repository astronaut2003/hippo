I will message you instructions in later messages. If you understand this instruction, limit your reply by saying the word: \"acknowledged\".\n\nHOME BUILDING ACT 1989 - SECT 3B\nDate of completion of residential building work\n3B Date of completion of residential building work\n(1A) This section does not apply to residential building work to which section 3C applies.\nNote : Section 3C provides for the date of completion of new buildings in strata schemes.\n(1) The completion of residential building work occurs on the date that the work is complete within the meaning of the contract under which the work was done.\n(2) If the contract does not provide for when work is complete (or there is no contract), the completion of residential building work occurs on\n\"practical completion\" of the work, which is when the work is completed except for any omissions or defects that do not prevent the work from being reasonably capable of being used for its intended purpose.\n(3) It is to be presumed (unless an earlier date for practical completion can be established) that practical completion of residential building work occurred on the earliest of whichever of the following dates can be established for the work--\n(a) the date on which the contractor handed over possession of the work to the owner,\n(b) the date on which the contractor last attended the site to carry out work (other than work to remedy any defect that does not affect practical completion),\n(c) the date of issue of an occupation certificate under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 that authorises commencement of the use or occupation of the work,\n(d) (in the case of owner-builder work) the date that is 18 months after the issue of the owner-builder permit for the work.\n(4) If residential building work comprises the construction of 2 or more buildings each of which is reasonably capable of being used and occupied separately, practical completion of the individual buildings can occur at different times (so that practical completion of any one building does not require practical completion of all the buildings).\n(5) This section applies for the purposes of determining when completion of residential building work occurs for the purposes of any provision of this Act, the regulations or a contract of insurance under Part 6.",

      "memory": "Huge congratulations on making the Dean's List! That's a fantastic achievement, and I'm more than happy to help you stay on track and organized for the upcoming semester.\n\nLet's create a planner or calendar that suits your needs. Since you have coursework, study group meetings, and online courses to manage, we'll focus on creating a system that can help you stay on top of all these commitments. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n**Option 1: Digital Calendar**\n\nYou can use a digital calendar like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Microsoft Outlook to stay organized. Here's how to set it up:\n\n1. Create a separate calendar for each type of commitment:\n\t* Coursework (lectures, assignments, and deadlines)\n\t* Study group meetings\n\t* Online courses (live sessions, assignments, and deadlines)\n2. Color-code each calendar to differentiate between the three categories.\n3. Set reminders for upcoming events, deadlines, and study sessions.\n4. Block dedicated time slots for studying, reviewing notes, and working on assignments.\n5. Consider sharing your calendar with your study group members or accountability partner to stay on the same page.\n\n**Option 2: Physical Planner**\n\nIf you prefer a physical planner, you can choose a notebook or binder with a layout that suits your style. Here's a suggested structure:\n\n1. Divide your planner into sections:\n\t* Coursework (one section per course)\n\t* Study group meetings\n\t* Online courses\n\t* Study schedule and to-do lists\n2. Create a weekly or bi-weekly spread to plan out your tasks, assignments, and study sessions.\n3. Use stickers, washi tape, or colorful pens to highlight important dates, deadlines, and events.\n4. Allocate dedicated pages for note-taking, brainstorming, and tracking your progress.\n5. Consider adding a motivational quote or goal-setting page to keep you motivated, like your Dean's List achievement!\n\n**Hybrid Approach**\n\nIf you prefer a mix of digital and physical planning, you can use a digital calendar for scheduling and a physical planner for note-taking and tracking progress.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. Set realistic goals and priorities for each week or study session.\n2. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.\n3. Schedule regular breaks and self-care activities to avoid burnout.\n4. Review and adjust your planner or calendar regularly to ensure it's working effectively for you.\n\nFeel free to customize these suggestions to fit your unique needs and preferences. Remember to celebrate your Dean's List achievement and use it as motivation to stay focused and driven throughout the semester!\n\nHow do these options sound? Do you have any specific preferences or requirements for your planner or calendar?",
