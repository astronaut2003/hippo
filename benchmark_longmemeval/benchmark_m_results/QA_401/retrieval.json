Since you mentioned you've been buying gifts for various occasions, let's try to quantify that.\n\nCan you tell me:\n\n1. How many gifts have you purchased in the past 3-6 months?\n2. What were the occasions for these gifts (e.g., birthdays, holidays, weddings, just because)?\n3. Approximately how much did you spend on each gift?\n\nWith this information, we can calculate your average gift expense and estimate a monthly allocation for the \"Gifts\" category.\n\nFor example, let's say you've purchased 5 gifts in the past 3 months, with an average cost of $15 per gift. That's a total of $75 in gift expenses over 3 months. To calculate a monthly allocation, we can divide that by 3:\n\n$75 ÷ 3 = $25 per month\n\nBased on this example, you might consider allocating 7-10% of your income to the \"Gifts\" category, depending on your overall financial situation and priorities.\n\nRemember, this is just an estimate, and you can adjust the allocation as needed based on your changing gift-giving habits and financial goals.\n\nHow do these questions help you think about your gift-giving expenses? Are there any other factors you'd like to consider when allocating funds for gifts?",
