I will ask you after the analysis to summarise the transcript and also tell me what you corrected. Just output uderstood after this prompt: here is the transcript: Mthokosi 0:00\nWhat are the challenges that you guys might be experiencing? So that's why we didn't say let's piggyback on that, and see how we continue to manage the kind of relations that we've built over the past couple of years. And then I think I will then jump into the introductions. I think what I will do, I will I will allow our colleagues from Sal to introduce themselves and then I'm then hand it over to you guys to then introduce yourself, I think on my side, I'm steering towards the symposium responsible for the contract will be a comment and I will then allow Hannah and Amanda visitor to record introduce themselves.\n\nUnknown 0:46\nOkay, good morning, once again, I'm sure you know me very well. And I'm from the data analytics division in South and we on a frequent basis with a similar theme pertaining to data and data set that helps you navigate around Thank you Good morning, everybody. My name is Robin today's\n\nUnknown 1:16\nprocurement working together with Mr. cosi I'll be assisting him on the contract. Thank you\n\nMthokosi 1:32\nYeah, I think you can you can be able to come to a menu, introduce yourself to the to your colleagues.\n\nMarina Short 1:43\nOkay, thank you. So for those of you that don't know me, my name is Marina short and proud CEO of consumer profile Bureau, and always refer to us as a proudly female, managed and pod owned credit bureau so very proud to be a partner to such and being able to make a difference in our beautiful country\n\nbrian jean 2:09\nare short on the Key Account Manager for the source account. So basically, everything runs through me on the middleman to make everything work.\n\nUnknown 2:23\nAlright, good morning, everyone. Good to see you again. Online. My name is Toby satsa. I'm heading up the News New Business Development Center. Great meeting everyone met Anna and welcome Robins first time learning material and other colleagues think you\n\nMthokosi 2:49\nknow, thanks a lot colleagues would think it means we have covered some part of the agenda, which is the introduction part and I think I've got a number of apologies from the colleagues from business coming close also from finance but the quality also from procurement because this last two weeks of the end of financial aid and pathetic but I thought we quality cannot postpone the meeting because we've noted this SRM for quite some time now. And I thought it's important that at least we will start the discussions and then we can be able to have a follow up meeting sometime next month I think which is what we've agreed on. To say the follow up meeting will be in the office well we'll also be able to see some of the things that you pious you for you've managed to put in place for over a couple of years. Having came through from the position where you are and to a position where now we are considered as one of the main player within the space and I think we just something that is very commendable. Yeah, no, I think and then another thing what I what I indicated was on the latest discussions to say they are going to put it here so that we can be able to make impulse to eat before we can be able to dive into it. So I will I will allow the team from cpp to then be able to submit their input before we can discuss the items that have been proposed.\n\nMarina Short 4:33\nI don't think we've got anything else on the agenda other than what you brought up like at nos also alluded to earlier. I think Erina as discussion she said twice a month but I think it's more like twice a week. At this stage and we've managed to our sink bolt a very good relationship and we deal with items as and when they occur. So I don't think anything else that I want to add to their agenda.\n\nMthokosi 5:00\nI think why not? Why not? Why don't we do our DCP bid team to to be able to give us an overview of the of the contract that is there any changes or any development that is m two. I think that they have a the items that CPP was our was appointed for in terms of how is the contract to the relation so far. Is there any one or two things I'm concerned so in other things that we should take note of such that we can be able to see as to how best we can assist you to amaze you the ambition is to go because the only 90 situations where we've seen the newspapers that are indicating that the relationship is not in a good space between Samsung and CPP Yeah.\n\nMarina Short 5:55\nYeah. Thank you. I think I'm Eugene. I don't know if you can maybe as you got the usage list. Maybe just me can actually share the records that has been utilized to date. I think that is the type of inquiries that has been accessed into our environment, maybe just a confirmation on I think the compliance processes. So with regards to the source contract and tender all the inquiries at the back end in our environment or footprint it but it's most so none of the inquiries will ever show on any front end credit report. It is not impacting anybody's credit score, and there's very limited access into that data set. So what Eugene is currently showing is the aggregated anonymized inquiries that has been done, which is in the report, but the detail around to access it for what purposes is available to site if they want to utilize that for any other purpose. But on our side, that data is actually hidden. And only people with specific axes can can see that so maybe just as a as an entry point. I think if we look at the inquiries that has been done, we see that there's quite a few inquiries that was done around business interest around screening, trusts people with trust and we see deeds and property ownership. We also see quite a bit of confirmations of records of deceased and the Home Affairs data and actually added to the other data sets that we have. So I think there's been also trace inquiries which we've seen a growth in into the trace inquiries, which means that you know, understanding the profile of a person is income, his assets and his liabilities, but also the contact ability to make sure that the person can be identified. So we've seen that increased and also good utility of things like the like I said, like the trust data. I think those are the standard inquiries, and those are balanced back into the billing reports. That is balanced back once again into the invoices and statements. We just on that I think we've also got the ad hoc projects which from time to time they do engage with us and the current project we're quite excited about is the one that we are actually assisting search to identify whether the the footprint is actually representative of way the consumers or the entities are. And we went to market with something that is our new to market on the individuals and we newly registered companies were actually done. And we've had some iterations we have also had some challenges around the data that sits in the address data. But things I've done quite a bit of work. We've had the team over December, worked extensively, to get the extracts done as quickly as possible. And we're very excited that as a side project from that project that was done if I remember correctly, Eugenia and add an ACC and maybe helped me but I think it was 110,000 consumers that was created active that we actually identified or a flag which is such that is currently not registered on the search database and I think that's the value add and exciting things that we want to be involved in not just the inquiries. So I think in a nutshell, that is that is the usage and the inquiries, I don't know, you know, I don't know. There's anything that are left out but you know, very excited that we also did. I think maybe just another point, as part of the value adds that we presented in our tender there was quite a few initiatives which we recommend it should be considered by such under the adult projects. And one of them was the income estimator way. estimating what a person's income is based on what he's spending in the market is actually a very good high risk flag indicator for SAS if that is compared to income that is actually declared. So I think that was one of the projects and I know it is currently under consideration. And I think another one which under the value s which I do think it's something in the future that could be a value is to bring the credit report in on the actual e filing. We believe that if people see that such can see what they spending and what the actual credit is that there will be more transparency and honesty on the actual declarations that is happening. So we've got quite a few value add projects but and we are continuously engaging with the team on that.\n\nMthokosi 11:27\nThanks a lot with that. I think in the main my interest will be that as part of your continuous discussions and engagement with our business stakeholders at mind the team member you need to start to discuss the value add proposition that was submitted with the be discharged and they can see as to what are the things or things that you guys you can be able to do beside what you're currently doing which is what you are currently touching based on because there are a number of ways in which we can still be able to increase the they take space which is the space that you guys are playing with him I think why do I still get this question what I wanted to check is to say do you guys also provide consumer behavior kind of projects, you know, we were able to tap into how does this certain group of consumer behaves which can then assist us to be able to know as to what is the best way to engage them to be able to get demand because a consumer behaves differently. So so so I think that's the question that I had around\n\nMarina Short 12:54\nhere definitely. in custody, I think what we've got is our artificial intelligence and machine learning. Division is something that I think the only thing we basically started touching on with value, as we already discussed, was actually the income estimator. And the income estimator for us was quite a good indicator of you know, what are people spending and, and, and the behavior. So we did another project for for the National Credit regulator. We we found 100,000 consumers, that is under debt review, but that's actually deceased. That is still being flagged as under debt review me we find in municipalities people that are indigent that owns property of over a million Rand and the behavior I think that that you referring to is absolutely something which I think when we have a bit of a workshop with a team with such is, you know, what are we trying to understand, do we want to target new to market consumers make sure that, you know, how do we engage with them? Where do they operate? How do we get them included in the base? Absolutely a project we would love to do. We have strengthened our artificial intelligence and machine learning departments and we are taking awesome things to market like possibility to lapse and a possibility to default and, you know, possibility to upsell for some of the clients and we are seeing things like flapping cycles consumers starting to miss payments of certain types of of the obligations and what we read from the these these very interesting things around. What we currently looking at is the CPI unemployment. What is happening with fuel levies, what is happening was the different stages of electricity and where people spending the money and where they're having trouble. And we would love to, you know, utilize those insights more effectively to help such to be able to fulfill their, their obligation to the country, but we're very excited to see how well so she's doing really it's, it's for us, we've got a lot of doom and gloom in the country and I think we are in a difficult phase or political environment, but I always try and focus on how can I make a difference how can I I cannot help the country and that's what we want to do. And I think that I think between Erina and Eugene, I think they've I really want to recommend the relationships I've managed to build or hardly ever have to step in. But sometimes it helps to just, you know, get me or hobby, so involved and then we can get the team and the office to run straight again. But I think we've built a very good relationship. And I'm actually very proud of the team and how well they're working together.\n\nUnknown 16:10\nYes I would just like to add to it Marina, just to give me two quizzes in like a practical example. As Marina indicated, we were told to expand the footprint of salt. So in order to decide based on data, we've now device These new offices, we we toast cpp to provide us with certain data, and I could actually share it with you, but in essence, I went really out of their way to provide us with the data. And like now even now in this week, as we are discussing it, they went the extra mile because we've realized that there are some lead side quality checks pertaining to that South African post office data that needs to be done and in squat and hybrid pause to do these quality checks because the soap information is not accurate. And there are like, let's say inconsistencies. But as we are speaking that busy with this quality assurance to do reruns based on the clean up and to provide us with even more clean up data. And in this week, we'll have a follow up meeting to discuss the outcome of this data set from my side. I just want to say and thank you for your professional way of doing things. It's comforting to us because we need to make informed decisions based on the title we're saving from you and you really, really go out of your way to ensure that it's the best quality given It is your source\n\nThis transcript was generated by https://otter.ai\n\nGet Outlook for Android",
