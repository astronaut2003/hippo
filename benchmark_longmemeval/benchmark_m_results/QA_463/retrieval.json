A content calendar is a great way to plan and organize your content in advance, ensuring consistency across all your platforms.\n\nTo get started, let's break down the process into a few steps:\n\n1. **Identify your goals**: What do you want to achieve with your social media content? Are you looking to drive website traffic, increase engagement, generate leads, or build brand awareness? Knowing your goals will help you create content that aligns with your objectives.\n2. **Choose your platforms**: Which social media platforms do you currently use, and which ones do you want to focus on? You mentioned TikTok, but do you also have presence on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or YouTube?\n3. **Determine your content themes**: What types of content do you typically post, or what topics do you want to cover? For example, do you share educational content, behind-the-scenes insights, product updates, or promotional offers?\n4. **Decide on a posting schedule**: How often do you want to post on each platform, and at what times? You may want to consider your audience's time zones, peak engagement hours, and your own content creation capacity.\n5. **Plan your content**: Using your goals, platforms, themes, and schedule as a guide, start brainstorming content ideas for the next few weeks or months. You can use a spreadsheet, a tool like Trello or Asana, or a dedicated content calendar template to organize your ideas.\n\nTo give you a head start, here's a simple content calendar template you can use:\n\n| Platform | Date | Content Theme | Post Type | Time |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TikTok | Mon, [Date] | Behind-the-scenes | Video | 3:00 PM |\n| Instagram | Tue, [Date] | Product feature | Image | 10:00 AM |\n| Facebook | Wed, [Date] | Educational content | Link | 2:00 PM |\n| Twitter | Thu, [Date] | Industry news | Tweet | 12:00 PM |\n\nFeel free to add or remove columns as needed.

and it got really positive feedback about how to actually monetize Twitter because there's a lot of talk on how to grow but I want to talk about how to monetize because you know making money is cooler than getting followers guys are cool but likes and cash anyway we talk about how to position yourself so you're not like everybody else creating an offer getting leads for that offer creating content that attracts leads that will actually buy that offer that are qualified and will pay you and just all things Twitter so without further Ado I hope you enjoy I'll do my best to show you everything I know about Twitter and what I teach people in my coaching program and my paid community and my free stuff it's kind of the same model but it's one model that really changed the way I look at Twitter when I got to 70 000 followers I met this guy his name's Tony and Tony was making the same amount of followers I was making when he had 900 followers and I had 70 000. right there I was like there's something wrong about this approach and the way people teach Twitter so I thought no I'm gonna do it right because if there's people with smaller followings making more money than me imagine if you had a big following and you use the examples and techniques smaller accounts use you make so much more money people tell you that if you just grow eventually the money will come like just grow and launch an offer when you already have an audience and you'll be fine to me it turned out to be I was launching the offer nobody was booking calls people were just saying like hey man this stuff is so valuable and nobody bought I had a bunch of freeloaders and of like low quality followers that were never going to buy from me just taking up space in my email list and space in my in my telegram channels and I didn't like it and I kind of grew a little bit disappointed on how people tell you you should monetize Twitter and uh a lot of them are not even making much money that's when I said okay let me try to change stuff up we started tweet hunter that made around 1.5 million dollars a year including clients that's also seven figure business you know evolving I realized like there's a few things that nobody's talking about when it comes to Twitter monetization and I don't want you to reach face in which you get to like a really high follower account and then you're secretly embarrassed because you're not making money so I'm going to show you how to monetize from the beginning and I will also show you how to not break Goodwill because a lot of people say the more you weight the bigger they ask and that is absolutely true but there are ways in which you can monetize without breaking Goodwill let's get this started you're here because you want to monetize your Twitter so let's look at why you haven't people tell you you should do Twitter like this first get traffic right build a big account and then once you have the big account a lot of people are going to come your way so you're gonna be fine you can just launch them an offer right because you already have a big following and uh you know what you don't really need to think about Market because you can pivot them this is how people tell you you should do it or how I was taught I should do it there's a few issues with that because what if the traffic you got isn't optimized for the offer or whatever the market you have is broke like number one business rule is we don't sell to broke people unless you're Banks then that is a very profitable business but in our case not really so what happens is you have the big account but you never think about what you're going to sell them or who are you even selling to so you end up with this thing that looks huge like this kind of dog that barks a lot but has no damage potential you know it just looks big it's all gas like all Sizzle no steak this is what I call the growth guide right because this is just grow it'll be fine right now I propose doing it the opposite way I propose going Market first which is what I'm going to talk about second we cover offers now that you already know which Market you're targeting now we're gonna cover okay what do you sell to them and only after we have something validated that we know like yeah people want this this is people consider this valuable do we think about traffic how do you send traffic to an offer that you know will work it's cooler if you know it's going to work before you spend a lot of months and years of your life in traffic which is exactly what I did wrong to me this looks like a strong Foundation this Market goes first right if you pick the right market then everything comes easily I used to think that getting eyeballs was the best skill then I thought creating offers was the best skill now I believe Market picking is the best skill my first favorite topic is business it's always been that but my second favorite topic it's always been dating and relationships if you look at me like I'm I look Korean because I'm I'm half Korean and you know how on Tinder you can change your location to go to any other place in the world so I changed it to South Korea just to see how I would do so I am the offer right because I'm the guy that you girls are gonna buy traffic is just me putting in front of them but Market is I chose South Korea and then nothing happened right because I just looked like everybody else there maybe my bio wasn't right right but whatever but then I researched maybe if I boost it right and I get more traffic and nothing let me change the offer maybe that's it let me change like a few pictures of me and some that look better didn't change anything but then I saw and I thought okay so where are South Korean dudes looking popular and turns out it's all problem it's in Europe that I changed my location and I'm not kidding like in in five minutes just qualified leads started rolling into the pipeline if you know what I mean and it was great it was honestly great nothing changed about the offer nothing changed about the traffic but everything changed about the market and that's when I really understood like maybe it's not Auto creation that's the best maybe it's not traffic generation that's the best maybe it's Market picking that's the best because really if you're Asian you just have to show up in east or Europe and have a pulse that's all you need to do but that's beyond the scope of this master class so this is the likes and cash method this is the growth guide method or the likes our cash method and to me it looks like this this doesn't have a strong Foundation it'll fall what happens when you find out there's a bunch of people from unqualified countries or just niches that are not going to buy it from you you know this one saves yourself pain this one sets you up for a wrong lesson it's like going into a toxic relationship like it feels good it's kind of fun but in reality you know you shouldn't be there right but you keep putting it away and you keep writing engagement and getting tweets and writing threads that nobody cares about because you want to put it away and you would think like oh because one day I'll get traffic and then launch an offer but you've done that over and over again and it's not making you money so you don't have to go down that you need to change the path of this case this is how I teach Twitter and that's what we'll do today we're gonna go step by step we're gonna go market first offer second and traffic through it because this is how I think that is the optimal wait first off let's start with market so the way I like to think about Market picking is one which skill do you possess I'm not asking for who can your skill benefit I'm not asking that I'm just asking what skills do you possess are you good at writing are you good at ghost riding are you going to getting people fit are you good at getting people girlfriends like wha filters so one is from the people you've seen on Twitter meaning it's easy to Target you own a market that's easy target two who could benefit the most meaning there's a pain right and who can pay you the most money again we don't sell to broke people right number one rule I like to ask this question Who on Twitter have you seen that could benefit the most from this and can pay you the most money right and you think about it long and hard for example there's this guy named Tyler Tyler is awesome at buy you a trip to Bali right and I'm also gonna name my first born son after you know like all these promises can end up getting more and more ridiculous so what positioning does is it allows you to not have the biggest outcome because you can only lose so many pounds in a week but it allows you to show people different roads so that they end up choosing your road over the others even though it's gonna take them to the same destination okay that's what positioning allows you to do not have the best offer which questions do you ask yourself to know if whether it's better for you to go complete or complete positioning the question you ask yourself for compete positioning is what are some false beliefs in my market like what false beliefs does my market have and then you go against it like in cash is one that one came natural to me because like I'm a fighter I've always been a fighter and I just I just like that Dynamic it feels natural and I can talk about it every day remember there's no one better than it's through this sentence I will prove to and this is where you put your personal we we already talked about the person remember like who are you talking to I'll prove to 2021 JK because that is my target market that my unique like saying cash Frameworks are the key to Twitter success I filter everything I say on my social media through this framework through this sentence of belief Russell calls this the big Domino statement I kind of tweaked it a little bit to make it like killer to me and Twitter but this is it there's two not making any money my next question will be okay what's your motor like like have you turned it on have you pitched 100 people on the DMS the offer is in the motor of it it's the wheels of your business okay now here's where I like to use a hormozy equation and honestly if you're gonna learn from anybody offer creation learn from Alex right 100 million offers he talks about four things that are very very actually pretty simple one is dream outcome and I want to add a few things here just so this big forest and it looks scary and you don't know if this this business model works best for that business model works best I end up doing this how many of you haven't done this where you're like man like I go through this route but I don't know I just wasn't getting any traction and then you changed the business model and then you go through another one and you're not getting much traction and you change the business model and that's where you up why because you don't know still that and what will turn this in from the right market and the right offer picking and the right traffic is you will make thirty thousand dollars a month in the end is there any questions where in regards to this process let's just not get caught up in the detail do you have any questions when it comes to the big picture usually they'll have questions and those are objections and we'll go over them but this is my explanation I just gave you my sales call explanation like a minute or two right it doesn't plan okay like if you want to lose weight you already know how to lose weight just eat less and work out more it's quite simple if you want to get a girlfriend it's very simple just dress well like look presentable and go talk to girls the plan isn't complex we don't have a strategy problem you'll already know the path we have an execution problem and that's why we lose because we can't stick to the triangles long enough so what do we do once once it's positioning it doesn't mean that you're do an hour prospecting and still make a lot of money one hour of prospecting pipeline management as in like you need to follow up with someone or send an invoice or whatever and engaging so remember how we talked about your dream 100 set up 30 minutes or an hour to engage with them the way you engage with them is you don't engage to steal their followers because everybody does it it's honestly like exhausting when you go and see that everybody's rephrasing the top accounts common but if you comment and I write it in a way that tackles your objections and that's how I write my case I say think about okay what would this person's objections usually be and I tackle them through the case study in a like a narrative way like I'm telling a story and it breaks their beliefs like hey this guy thought that truck in college was a pain but turns out you can do it in the toilet and now he's ripped five testimonials what was like before and what impact did it have what's life after and what impact did it does it makes you feel good it makes you feel like they can trust you we talk about what a good salesman does but not that often we talk about what a good Prospect is you're going to work with them you'll see their face a lot so you might as well find the good ones a good Prospect is willing to talk if there's something to be discussed they're willing to do it we're not asking for a lot here a good Prospect will also respect you and a good Prospect is not broke so what am I talking about this who are like don't have more than three months of payroll left really get those sources going we get the money first and then we figure out ways to keep that going and the way that works is we set up a call with the team that worked for it and then what I like to do is I like to give the urgency awesome well here's the link would you mind booking now because I'm online and I can just prepare some stuff for you beforehand that's really how I start by chat\"\nSummarize in bulletpoints",

Are there any specific challenges or pain points that your audience is facing, and how can your social media strategy help address them?\n3. What are your competitors doing on social media, and how can you differentiate your brand from theirs? Are there any gaps or opportunities that your competitors have not yet addressed on social media?\n4. What types of content do you plan to create and share on social media, and how do you plan to measure the success of your content? Will you be using a mix of visual and written content, such as photos, videos, blog posts, infographics, or social media ads?\n5. What is your social media budget, and how will you allocate it across different social media channels and activities? Will you be using any social media management or analytics tools to help track and optimize your performance?\n6. What is your posting frequency and schedule, and how will you engage with your audience on social media? Will you be using any influencer partnerships or user-generated content campaigns to help increase your reach and engagement?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can begin to develop a tailored social media strategy that is specific to your brand and target audience. This may include setting clear goals and objectives, creating a content calendar and production plan, identifying the best social media channels to use and the types of content that work best on each channel, and implementing a measurement and optimization plan to track and adjust your performance over time.",
