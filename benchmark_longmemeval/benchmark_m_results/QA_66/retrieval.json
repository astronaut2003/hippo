As a member with the membership number 050205, and having served as the state-level mobilization head (JKEN) in Wilayah Persekutuan, I believe I have the skills and experience to bring my creative flair to your team.\n\nWith a bachelor's degree in professional communication from The International University of Malaya-Wales, I have a solid foundation in the principles of effective communication. But what really sets me apart is my ability to think outside the box and bring a sense of humor and wit to my work. Whether it's through photography, videography, public relations, or event management, I know how to grab people's attention and engage them with my pun-filled writing style.\n\nOf course, no graphic designer is complete without a strong understanding of Adobe software, and I'm happy to say that I'm proficient in all the tools you could possibly need. So if you're looking for a designer who can bring a fresh perspective, a bit of sass, and top-notch technical skills to the table, I'm your guy.\n\nI look forward to the opportunity to bring my talents to MUDA and help spread your message to the masses.\n\nSincerely,\nFitri Ramli",
