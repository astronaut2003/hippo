In a study published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, 15 subjects with anxiety and depression listened to binaural beats daily for four weeks. The study found significant improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as reduced stress levels.\n\n2. A study published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology found that binaural beats can positively affect mood and emotional states. The study found that subjects who listened to binaural beats reported significantly less anxiety and more positive moods than those who didn't listen to the beats.\n\n3. Another study published in the journal Music and Medicine involved 38 subjects who listened to binaural beats for 30 minutes daily for three weeks. The study found significant reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these studies suggest the effectiveness of binaural beats in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, more research is needed to fully understand their potential benefits and limitations as a treatment for mental health disorders.",

Here are a few techniques that have worked for other musicians:\n\n1. Deep breathing - Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. You can also try counting to ten as you inhale and exhale slowly.\n\n2. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) - Tense and relax your muscles in a systematic way. Start with your feet and work your way up to your head, tensing each muscle group for a few seconds before releasing.\n\n3. Visualization - Imagine a relaxing scene, such as a peaceful beach or a quiet forest. Focus on the details of the scene and feel the relaxation washing over you.\n\n4. Mindfulness meditation - Focus on your breath and your thoughts without judgment. Observe your thoughts as they come and go, without getting caught up in them.\n\n5. Yoga or gentle stretching - Engage in gentle physical activity to release tension and promote relaxation.\n\nIt's a good idea to practice these techniques regularly, so that you are familiar with them and can use them effectively when you need them.",

CBT is a fantastic approach to addressing anxiety and negative thought patterns.\n\nAbsolutely, I think it's essential to discuss your morning anxiety attacks with your therapist. They can help you explore potential underlying causes, identify patterns, and develop strategies to manage your morning anxiety.\n\nHere are some reasons why you should bring it up with your therapist:\n\n**1. They can help you identify triggers:** Your therapist can work with you to explore potential triggers or contributing factors that might be causing your morning anxiety attacks.\n\n**2. They can provide additional coping strategies:** Your therapist can offer additional techniques or strategies to help you manage your morning anxiety, such as relaxation exercises, visualization, or thought-stopping techniques.\n\n**3. They can help you develop a morning routine:** Your therapist can help you create a calming and relaxing morning routine to help you start your day on a more positive note.\n\n**4. They can assess for underlying conditions:** Your therapist can assess whether your morning anxiety attacks might be related to an underlying condition, such as sleep anxiety disorder, and help you develop a plan to address it.\n\n**5. They can provide support and guidance:** Your therapist can offer emotional support and guidance as you work through this challenging time.\n\nWhen you discuss your morning anxiety attacks with your therapist, be sure to provide as much detail as possible, such as:\n\n* How often you're experiencing morning anxiety attacks\n* The intensity and duration of the attacks\n* Any triggers or patterns you've noticed\n* How you've been feeling physically and emotionally during the attacks\n* Any coping strategies you've tried so far\n\nRemember, your therapist is there to support you and help you develop a personalized plan to manage your anxiety. Don't hesitate to bring up any concerns or challenges you're facing.\n\nHow do you feel about discussing this with your therapist? Is there anything in particular that's holding you back or making you hesitant to bring it up?",
