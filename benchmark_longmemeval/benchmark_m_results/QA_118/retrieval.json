Many people believed that it was not appropriate for women to engage in academic pursuits or be involved in the establishment of educational institutions.\n\nDespite these challenges, Lady Elizabeth de Valence was able to overcome these obstacles and establish Jesus College as a center of learning and scholarship. Her determination and commitment to education, as well as her strong belief in the role of women in society, helped to pave the way for other women to follow in her footsteps and pursue their own academic and professional goals. While she faced significant challenges due to her gender, her success in founding Jesus College demonstrated that women were capable of making valuable contributions to society in all fields.",
