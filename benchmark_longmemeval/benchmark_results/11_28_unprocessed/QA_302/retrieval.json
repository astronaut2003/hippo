In 2019 alone, over 1,000 new affordable housing units were created.\n\n2.

Here are a few tips to protect yourself from scams:\n\n1. Do your research: Before booking a tour, research the company online, check reviews from previous customers, and make sure it's a reputable and trustworthy operator.\n\n2. Check the price: Be wary of tours that are significantly cheaper than others in the area. A very low price may be a sign of a low-quality tour or an unreliable operator.\n\n3. Ask questions: Ask detailed questions about the tour, the itinerary, and what is included in the price. If the operator is vague about the details or is hesitant to answer your questions, it might be a red flag.\n\n4. Pay attention to hidden fees: Some operators may add extra fees, such as entrance fees or transportation costs, that are not included in the advertised price. Make sure you ask about any extra costs before booking the tour.\n\n5. Use a reputable booking platform: Consider booking your tours through a reliable platform, like Viator or GetYourGuide, which tend to work with trustworthy local tour operators.\n\n6. Use common sense: Always be vigilant and use common sense when dealing with operators. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nBy being diligent and doing your homework, you can help ensure that you have a safe and enjoyable tour experience.",
