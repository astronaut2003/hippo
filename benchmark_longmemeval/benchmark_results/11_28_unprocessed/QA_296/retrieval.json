You'll find many spots serving them, but here are some iconic places to try:\n\n**Top Italian Beef Spots:**\n\n1. **Al's Beef**: A Chicago staple since 1977, with multiple locations. Try the original location on Taylor Street.\n2. **Mr. Beef**: Another classic spot, featured on TV shows and movies, including \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Blues Brothers.\"\n3. **Portillo's**: While they're famous for hot dogs, their Italian beef sandwiches are also a hit.\n4. **Johnnie's Beef**: A family-owned institution since 1967, with a nostalgic atmosphere.\n\n**How to Order Like a Local:**\n\n1. **Order it \"hot\" or \"sweet\":** Specify how you like your giardiniera, a spicy pickled vegetable mix. \"Hot\" means with hot giardiniera, while \"sweet\" means with sweet peppers instead.\n2. **Ask for it \"wet\" or \"dry\":** \"Wet\" means the sandwich will be dipped in the juices, making the bread soggy and flavorful. \"Dry\" means it won't be dipped, keeping the bread crispy.\n3. **Choose your cheese (optional):** Provolone or mozzarella are common options. Some places might offer other cheeses, but these are the traditional choices.\n4. **Don't be afraid to customize:** If you want extra giardiniera, cheese, or a specific type of bread, ask! Chicagoans are known for their straightforwardness, so don't hesitate to customize your order.\n\n**Example Order:**\n\n\"I'll take an Italian beef sandwich, hot, wet, with provolone cheese, please.\"\n\nor\n\n\"Can I get an Italian beef, sweet, dry, with mozzarella?\"\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be prepared for a messy, juicy sandwich. You might want to grab some napkins!\n* Try to avoid ordering during peak lunch hours (11:30 am - 1:30 pm) to avoid long lines.\n* If you're not sure what to order, ask the staff for recommendations or guidance. They'll be happy to help.\n\nEnjoy your Italian beef adventure in Chicago!",

We know that Alex Ferguson also threw a shoe at David Beckham. It's said that Fatih Terim also did such things sometimes. Knowing that my players' families are with me makes me happy. Today, my phones never stopped ringing, both from people writing to me on social media and those who called me personally to express their positive thoughts about me, it made me happy. There are also those who cursed my deceased mother. I identified them, and I will start the necessary legal process. My doing such things does not give anyone the right to curse me, because I love my players. I have a brother-father relationship with them. I know that I carried a player who had his leg in plaster to the third floor on my back. It was not something that should have been done, but it was during a match. Just like a married couple's bedroom is private, a coach's locker room is also private. There are situations like this that happen to achieve victory and win the cup. As I said, this is a method used by many coaches. Now we have become the scapegoat,\"",
