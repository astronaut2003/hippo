By doing so, you'll attract potential buyers who are looking for a high-quality tripod and are willing to pay a premium for it.\n\nRemember to also emphasize any additional features or accessories that come with the tripod, such as the original box, instructions, or any other extras. This can help differentiate your listing from others and make it more appealing to buyers.\n\nI'm also glad to hear that your new remote shutter release is working well! Losing accessories can be frustrating, but it's great that you were able to replace it quickly and easily. February 5th seems like a productive day for you, with both ordering a new remote shutter release and realizing you needed to organize your camera bag!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance on selling your tripod or any other photography-related topics, feel free to ask. Good luck with the sale of your tripod, and I hope you get a great deal!",

It's always exciting to get new gear and explore new creative possibilities.\n\nNow, let's talk about backing up your precious photos! External hard drives are a great way to safeguard your files, and Western Digital and LaCie are both excellent brands. Here are some recommendations from those brands, as well as a few other options to consider:\n\n**Western Digital:**\n\n1. **Western Digital My Book**: A popular and affordable option with a compact design. Available in various capacities, including 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB.\n2. **Western Digital My Passport**: A portable and rugged option with a built-in cable and optional password protection. Capacities range from 1TB to 5TB.\n\n**LaCie:**\n\n1. **LaCie Rugged**: A durable and water-resistant option designed for on-the-go photographers.

Calculate the total size of your photo library and add some extra space for future growth.\n2. **Speed**: If you plan to transfer large files frequently, look for drives with fast transfer speeds (e.g., USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt 3).\n3. **Durability**: If you're planning to take your drive on the go, consider rugged or waterproof options.\n4. **Compatibility**: Make sure the drive is compatible with your computer's operating system and has the right interface (e.g., USB, Thunderbolt).\n5. **Warranty and Support**: Check the manufacturer's warranty and customer support in case you encounter any issues.\n\nRemember to always follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies of your data, stored on two different types of media, with one copy offsite. This will ensure your photos are safe and secure.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!",

How are you?\n12s Eric Cameron Yeah, I'm doing really well. Thanks. How are you? I'm\n14s Matt Brown good. Doing great. Awesome. Well hey,, I appreciate the time today. I saw from the invite you had invited a couple of other team members.\n24s Matt Brown Should we give them a couple of minutes? Yeah, we can give\n28s Eric Cameron them a minute or so. Let's see. I got Trina.\n34s Matt Brown Yeah. Really\n37s Eric Cameron awesome. Hi. Good morning, Trina.\n43s Matt Brown Good morning, guys. How are you guys\n44s Trina Berks doing? Really well. Thank you. And\n47s Matt Brown yourself. I'm doing great.\n50s Trina Berks Awesome. Right? Right. So is\n54s Eric Cameron the team based in Austin, Texas,\n56s Matt Brown primarily or fully? Primarily we\n1m 0s Eric Cameron have main locations right now, at least in Austin and Chicago. So that is soon to expand a bit. Possible. That's exciting I'm.\n1m 11s Eric Cameron I'm dialing\n1m 11s Matt Brown in from Canada, so I'll be sure to mix in some saris and you know all, the other stereotypical Canadian things during the call today.\n1m 21s Matt Brown But I'm really excited to to get to meet the team so good. I worked\n1m 26s Eric Cameron with I worked for a Canadian company for years so know all about it. Awesome, awesome,\n1m 33s Matt Brown cool.\n1m 33s Matt Brown So with everybody on the call, I think the best way to start is just quickly go around quick intro and the objective or outcome rather that you're looking to achieve from the call and then we can dive in from there.\n1m 46s Matt Brown So I mean, I can kick things off. My name is Matthew I'm. an account executive here at Fellow.\n1m 50s Matt Brown I had worked with the the data team originally at arrived so with Tyler and Alex in terms of introducing them to Fellow seem to have been a pretty positive response.\n2m 2s Matt Brown Little did they know that other team teams within the the organization were using Fellow as well So. yes, the the shut off was a bit of a catalyst but excited to connect with the greater arrive team.\n2m 14s Matt Brown I can go.\n2m 16s Eric Cameron Eric Cameron, VP of People Operations.\n2m 18s Eric Cameron So maybe I'm part of that catalyst, but I guess to have a little bit of context, we do currently use a different system for one on one.\n2m 28s Eric Cameron And so part of the idea of kind of testing out Fellow a bit was to see what it was capable of and to see if it was a platform that we ultimately wanted to move to from an organization\n2m 39s Matt Brown wide perspective. So that's kind of why we're we're\n2m 42s Eric Cameron all here is to learn more and see what possibilities exist. I'm Nick Sarkissian.\n2m 50s Nick Sarkesian I'm the director of Business Applications.\n2m 52s Nick Sarkesian So I help to strategically manage a lot of our third party apps, hopefully help the business onboard them more easily and just generally help out where needed.\n3m 10s Nick Sarkesian I'm Trina Burks. I\n3m 11s Trina Berks am a technical program manager for the business apps team. So I kind of work alongside Nick and just, you know, try to help the business out, kind of like what he was saying.\n3m 22s Trina Berks Great. Hi. Lucas Cooper here. Business\n3m 25s Coop Applications Manager. I work with Sark. Primarily on the finance applications for logistics. And I brought Coop in\n3m 35s Nick Sarkesian this call because he was using Fellow as well. So any feedback from him during the conversation to I think would be valuable.\n3m 44s Nick Sarkesian Awesome. Well. Well, thank you everyone\n3m 45s Matt Brown for who's already been using Fellow. Now it's from that adoption that this call really came about. So now understanding everybody on the call and the objectives, I mean I, did my research as well.\n3m 58s Matt Brown So I saw that you, Eric, had brought your muscle from the biceps team.\n4m 2s Matt Brown You know, typically what that means is taking a third party app from the shadows into a centralized managed location, you know having, that under the apps team.\n4m 14s Matt Brown So we'll certainly touch on security aspects, what that process looks like from a security review and everything along the lines, how we can help support that, check those boxes as well as as sharing a little bit more about fellow's main use case, which is powering those meetings internally too.\n4m 35s Matt Brown So Eric, rest of the team, what would be the the best place to start on that? I think. Do you want to\n4m 47s Eric Cameron start with security, Nick? Does that make sense and kind of how we can integrate it?\n4m 51s Eric Cameron Because I think that's part of what we're looking for, Matt, is really to start to say as we continue to grow as an organization, how do we start to, number one, tie things in that help to ensure that we're keeping our information secure, but also to make sure that we're automating as much of the new employees terminate and employees being added in or removed from systems, things like that.\n5m 15s Eric Cameron Yeah. Yeah. We use\n5m 17s Nick Sarkesian Okta internally, so if you guys are able to connect to that, that makes everyone's jobs on the I.T. side a lot easier. And obviously security aspects from that.\n5m 30s Nick Sarkesian And we utilize Workday as our his system. So I'm not sure if you all have integrations. I should have taken a look before with Workday as well.\n5m 43s Nick Sarkesian So for Iris,\n5m 45s Matt Brown we do sync with I'm pulling it up. So yes, we do have Workday.\n5m 49s Matt Brown So you're you're off the hook, Nick and then yes, we integrate directly with Okta as well So. just centrally managing the the entire organization versus having to play Chase and everything like that.\n6m 3s Matt Brown So we certainly want to make your life easier.\n6m 6s Matt Brown We want to stay on the good side of it in terms of some other like security specific documentation I, will get the ball rolling, send you over our security compliance dock.\n6m 16s Matt Brown And we do also have a SOC to report as well behind an NDA. So looping in the the rest of the team, it's security review team as well.\n6m 30s Matt Brown We can get that started too, especially if we are going to deploy at the the enterprise level. Certainly want to hash that out and make sure that's not a any barrier to moving forward.\n6m 41s Matt Brown Great. Cool. Yeah, I'll send\n6m 42s Nick Sarkesian that over to them the minute you get it over. So\n6m 48s Matt Brown I will have my security documentation off integration and then I will send the NDA over all part of this as a recap from our conversation.\n6m 58s Matt Brown So everybody on the call will excuse me be included in that. So full, full transparency there. Great. I guess to get a bit more\n7m 10s Eric Cameron tactical on the product itself, Matt, what's what's the difference between what we had?\n7m 17s Eric Cameron I would imagine we probably had the pro I'm guessing you pro versus enterprise, like what sorts of additional functionality is available as part of that?\n7m 27s Eric Cameron That's a really good question, Eric. So\n7m 29s Matt Brown it's the difference between is frankly, one is built for teams. That's the pro plan enterprise is built for company wide deployments.\n7m 39s Matt Brown So on the back end side, security side, having those more robust integrations to Okta. What else is there, the meaning analytics as well.\n7m 54s Matt Brown So just in terms of like being able to mandate, standardize and track one to ones across the entire org Fellow is going to unlock the entire suite of functionality which includes opening that up to everybody, one being able to centralize manage the the one to ones as well and visibility into which managers are running and using fellow using agendas for their their meetings and who might not be.\n8m 24s Matt Brown And as a result of that, who might need a little bit more support and we can certainly have that as well provide that support as well.\n8m 31s Matt Brown So in a nutshell, it's being able to to scale effectively fellows meeting functionality from one team to an entire organization.\n8m 45s Matt Brown We do have a great side by side comparison of the plans, you know, at the scale that we're looking for. The deployment enterprise functionality is certainly there.\n8m 58s Matt Brown We do have OKR tracking as well. So embedding that in feedback suite too.\n9m 4s Matt Brown So having that all centrally, centrally managed within the Fellow tool versus having potentially multiple providers doing a little bit of everything when it comes to review time or checking back into some of those conversations or tracking OKRs, it's difficult when that information lives in multiple places so, boiling it down, it's going to fail is going to be a single source of truth.\n9m 34s Matt Brown For the tracking\n9m 37s Nick Sarkesian of OKRs. How is it all like user entered or as a business, are we able to kind of upload things into it and set those for teams?\n9m 47s Nick Sarkesian How does that operate? Really good question. So our current\n9m 52s Matt Brown iteration of Fellowes Analytics, I'll just pop it open. It's it's designed, you know, it can be for the entire organization or just a single team.\n10m 3s Matt Brown So it does give you the flexibility to build that out. Fellow will work with your team.\n10m 9s Matt Brown So the senior leadership team, in order to import those objectives within Fellow and through the ability to toggle visibility, you can have your sea level objectives maybe just contain self-contained within the C-suite.\"",

Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Online Marketplaces (eBay, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, etc.):**\n\nPros:\n\n* Wider audience: Online marketplaces reach a vast number of potential buyers, increasing the chances of selling your tripod quickly.\n* Flexibility: You can set your own price, write a detailed description, and add photos to showcase your tripod's condition.\n* Convenience: You can sell from the comfort of your own home, and shipping is often straightforward.\n\nCons:\n\n* Competition: Online marketplaces can be competitive, and you might need to lower your price to attract buyers.\n* Safety concerns: Be cautious when dealing with strangers online, and make sure to follow safety guidelines and use secure payment methods.\n* Shipping hassle: You'll need to package and ship the tripod, which can be time-consuming and costly.\n\n**Local Camera Store:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Instant cash: You can get immediate payment and avoid the hassle of shipping.\n* In-person inspection: The camera store can inspect the tripod and verify its condition, giving you a more accurate price.\n* Support local business: You're supporting a local business and contributing to your community.\n\nCons:\n\n* Limited audience: The camera store's customer base might be limited, reducing the chances of selling your tripod quickly.\n* Lower price: The camera store might offer a lower price since they need to make a profit when reselling the tripod.\n* Limited negotiation: You might have less room for price negotiation compared to online marketplaces.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n* How quickly do you need to sell the tripod?\n* Are you comfortable with shipping and online transactions?\n* Is the tripod in excellent condition, and do you have all the original accessories?\n* Do you have a local camera store that you trust and frequent?\n\nIf you're short on time or want to reach a broader audience, online marketplaces might be the way to go. However, if you prefer a more personal transaction and want to support a local business, selling to a camera store could be the better option.\n\nWhichever route you choose, make sure to:\n\n* Research the market value of your tripod to set a competitive price.\n* Take clear, well-lit photos of the tripod from multiple angles.\n* Write an honest and detailed description of the tripod's condition.\n* Be prepared to answer questions from potential buyers.\n\nGood luck with the sale of your tripod!",

High-end moisturizer\n\n**Category:** Beauty/Skincare\n**Total Cost:** $1,500\n\nI've added the new purchase to your log. That's a total of $1,580 spent so far.\n\nIt's great that you're investing in your skincare routine, but I have to ask: Are you sure you want to spend that much on a moisturizer? While La Mer is a reputable brand, $1,500 is a significant amount for a single product. Have you considered exploring more affordable options or alternatives that might achieve similar results?\n\nRemember, being mindful of your spending habits is not just about tracking your expenses, but also about making intentional purchasing decisions that align with your values and goals.\n\nWould you like to explore ways to optimize your skincare routine without breaking the bank? I can offer some suggestions or recommendations if you'd like!",

However, I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to real-time or specific bus schedules. But I can guide you on how to find the information you need.\n\nHere are a few options to get the bus schedule:\n\n1. **Check the transit agency's website**: Look up the website of the transit agency that operates the bus service in your area. Most transit agencies have online schedules and trip planners that allow you to enter your route and time to get the schedule.\n2. **Use a transit app**: Download a transit app like Moovit, Transit, or Citymapper that provides real-time bus schedules and trip planning. These apps often have access to schedules for multiple transit agencies.\n3. **Check the bus stop or transit center**: Visit the bus stop or transit center near your location and check the posted schedules or printed timetables.\n4. **Call the transit agency's customer service**: Reach out to the transit agency's customer service number or contact form to ask for the schedule information.\n\nTo get the specific schedule for the 7:45 AM bus on Mondays and Tuesdays, and the 8:00 AM bus on Wednesdays, you can try the following:\n\n* On the transit agency's website, enter your route and the specific time you're looking for (e.g., 7:45 AM on Monday) to get the schedule.\n* Use the transit app to plan your trip and select the specific time you want to travel.\n* Check the printed schedules at the bus stop or transit center for the specific times you're looking for.\n\nRemember to double-check the schedule before your trip to ensure you have the most up-to-date information.\n\nIf you need any more help or have further questions, feel free to ask!",
