Finally, the code selects the top 3 selling departments and prints them.\n\nYou can then compare the top 3 selling departments for Store 10 with the top 3 selling departments across all stores, excluding Store 10, to see if there are any differences. You can use various techniques, such as visualization or statistical tests, to analyze the differences, depending on the specific research question and data characteristics.",

And you're right, it's also a great choice for hiding scuffs and stains.\n\nNow, when it comes to the finish, it ultimately depends on your mom's personal style and preferences. Here are some considerations for both matte and glossy finishes:\n\n**Matte finish:**\n\n* A matte finish will give the loafers a more understated, subtle look.\n* It's a great choice if your mom prefers a more low-key, elegant style.\n* Matte finishes can also help to reduce fingerprints and smudges.\n\n**Glossy finish:**\n\n* A glossy finish will give the loafers a sleek, polished look.\n* It's a great choice if your mom likes to make a statement with her shoes.\n* Glossy finishes can also help to reflect light and add a touch of sophistication to an outfit.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could consider the following:\n\n* If your mom tends to dress more formally or likes to add a touch of elegance to her outfits, a glossy finish might be a good choice.\n* If your mom prefers a more casual, relaxed style, a matte finish might be a better fit.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide which finish you think your mom would prefer. You know her style and preferences best, so trust your instincts!\n\nI hope that helps, and I'm sure your mom will love the loafers regardless of the finish you choose!",
