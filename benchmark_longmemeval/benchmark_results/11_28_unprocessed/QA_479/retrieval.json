The framework was also able to significantly reduce the gap between the performance of models trained on synthetic data and those trained on real data, with a reduction of up to 4 points on the 200mm domain in the Increasing Storm scenario.

      "memory": "Congratulations on breaking the 60-second barrier and earning the \"Golden Gear\" award! That's a fantastic achievement, especially as a novice driver.\n\nImproving your autocross skills takes time, practice, and a willingness to learn. Here are some tips to help you continue shaving off precious seconds from your lap times:\n\n1. **Review and analyze your runs**: Watch videos of your runs, if possible, or ask a friend to observe and provide feedback. Identify areas where you can improve, such as:\n\t* Slow corners or sections where you're losing speed.\n\t* Inconsistent braking or acceleration points.\n\t* Understeer or oversteer moments that cost you time.\n2. **Focus on smoothness and consistency**: Smooth, consistent driving is key to fast lap times. Work on:\n\t* Smooth braking and acceleration inputs.\n\t* Gradual, deliberate steering inputs.\n\t* Avoiding sudden corrections or jerky movements.\n3. **Master the art of cornering**: Corners are where you can gain or lose the most time. Practice:\n\t* Looking where you want to go, not at the apex.\n\t* Using the correct racing line (inside-outside-inside).\n\t* Braking before the turn-in point, not during.\n\t* Accelerating smoothly out of the turn.\n4. **Improve your braking technique**: Proper braking is crucial for fast lap times. Focus on:\n\t* Braking in a straight line before turning.\n\t* Using the correct braking points and zones.\n\t* Gradually releasing the brakes as you turn in.\n\t* Avoiding brake lockup or wheelspin.\n5. **Work on your car control**: Develop your skills in controlling your vehicle's dynamics, such as:\n\t* Managing weight transfer during cornering.\n\t* Catching and correcting understeer or oversteer.\n\t* Using throttle and brake to adjust your trajectory.\n6. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more comfortable and confident you'll become. Try to:\n\t* Attend multiple events or practice sessions.\n\t* Experiment with different driving styles and techniques.\n\t* Focus on specific skills, like cornering or braking, during practice.\n7. **Get feedback from instructors or experienced drivers**: Seek guidance from those with more experience. They can provide valuable insights and help you identify areas for improvement.\n8. **Stay focused and mentally prepared**: Autocross can be mentally demanding. Make sure to:\n\t* Stay hydrated and energized during events.\n\t* Manage your nerves and stay focused on the task at hand.\n\t* Visualize your runs and plan your strategy before each session.\n9. **Tune your car**: Ensure your vehicle is properly set up and maintained. Make adjustments to:\n\t* Tire pressure and alignment.\n\t* Suspension settings and ride height.\n\t* Brake pads and fluid.\n10. **Stay humble and patient**: Improvement takes time. Don't get discouraged by setbacks or plateaus. Stay committed to your training, and you'll continue to see progress.\n\nRemember, the key to improvement is consistent practice and a willingness to learn. Keep working on your skills, and you'll be shaving off precious seconds in no time!",

Here are some tips to help you prepare:\n\n1. **Study the course map**: Get your hands on the course map as soon as possible. Study it carefully, looking for:\n\t* Key features: turns, straights, and transitions.\n\t* Corner types: sweepers, hairpins, and kinks.\n\t* Braking zones and acceleration points.\n\t* Potential passing zones and areas to defend.\n2. **Walk the course**: If possible, arrive early and walk the course before the event. This will help you:\n\t* Get a feel for the track's elevation changes and camber.\n\t* Identify reference points, such as cones, curbs, or landmarks.\n\t* Visualize your racing line and braking points.\n3. **Use online resources**: Utilize online tools and resources, such as:\n\t* Google Earth or satellite imagery to get a bird's-eye view of the track.\n\t* YouTube videos or virtual laps from previous events.\n\t* Forums or social media groups where drivers share their experiences and tips.\n4. **Learn the track's characteristics**: Research the track's surface, grip levels, and any unique features, such as:\n\t* Asphalt or concrete surface: how it affects tire wear and grip.\n\t* Camber and banking: how it affects turn-in and cornering speed.\n\t* Bumps, curbs, or other obstacles: how to navigate them safely.\n5. **Develop a strategy**: Based on your analysis, create a strategy for the course, including:\n\t* Braking points and zones.\n\t* Turn-in points and apexes.\n\t* Acceleration points and gear shifts.\n\t* Passing opportunities and defensive driving techniques.\n6. **Mental preparation**: Visualize yourself driving the course successfully. Imagine:\n\t* Yourself executing perfect laps, with smooth turns and precise braking.\n\t* Overcoming challenges, such as tight corners or fast straights.\n\t* Staying focused and calm under pressure.\n7. **Setup your car**: Make sure your vehicle is properly set up for the new track, considering:\n\t* Tire pressures and camber settings.\n\t* Suspension adjustments for the track's surface and elevation changes.\n\t* Brake pad and fluid condition.\n8. **Get familiar with the local rules**: Review the event organizers' rules and regulations, including:\n\t* Course restrictions, such as speed limits or passing zones.\n\t* Safety requirements, like helmet and harness regulations.\n\t* Penalties for course deviations or infractions.\n9. **Plan your event day**: Arrive early, and plan your day accordingly, including:\n\t* Arrival time, registration, and tech inspection.\n\t* Course walks, driver's meetings, and grid assignments.\n\t* Time for warm-up laps, practice, and qualifying.\n10. **Stay flexible**: Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on changing conditions, such as:\n\t* Weather: rain, wind, or temperature changes.\n\t* Track conditions: oil spills, debris, or surface changes.\n\t* Competition: adjusting your strategy based on your competitors' performance.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well-prepared for the new track and course layout at the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana. Stay focused, and you'll be driving like a pro in no time!",

      "memory": "The article discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control a building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The researchers propose a DRL algorithm that learns to optimize the energy consumption of a multi-zone HVAC system while ensuring occupant comfort. The algorithm uses a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn an optimal control policy from a state-action value function. The researchers use a simulation environment to test the algorithm and compare its performance to other control strategies. They show that the DRL algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of energy consumption and occupant comfort. The article concludes that DRL can be an effective method for controlling HVAC systems in buildings.",
