      "memory": "What a thought-provoking question! The concept of \"investment pieces\" in fashion is indeed a popular notion, and it's great that you're reflecting on your spending habits.\n\n**What are investment pieces?**\n\nInvestment pieces are high-quality, timeless, and often expensive fashion items that are meant to be worn and enjoyed for years to come. They're typically made from exceptional materials, crafted with attention to detail, and designed to withstand the test of time. Examples include luxury handbags, quality watches, and high-end clothing from renowned designers.\n\n**Are investment pieces worth the splurge?**\n\nIt depends on your personal values, lifestyle, and financial situation. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Quality and durability:** Investment pieces are built to last, ensuring you'll enjoy them for years to come.\n2. **Timeless style:** Classic designs won't go out of fashion quickly, making them a wise investment for those who value longevity.\n3. **Resale value:** Luxury items can retain their value or even appreciate over time, making them a potential investment opportunity.\n4. **Emotional connection:** Investment pieces can evoke feelings of confidence, joy, and satisfaction, making them a worthwhile splurge for some.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **High upfront cost:** Investment pieces often come with a hefty price tag, which can be daunting for many.\n2. **Opportunity cost:** The money spent on an investment piece could be allocated to other areas of your life, such as saving, investing, or experiences.\n3. **Overspending justification:** The concept of investment pieces can be used to rationalize overspending or justify purchases that might not align with your values or budget.\n4. **Alternative options:** You might find similar quality and style at a lower price point from more affordable brands or second-hand sources.\n\n**Ultimately, it's about alignment with your values and priorities:**\n\nIf you value quality, timeless style, and are willing to invest in pieces that bring you joy and confidence, then investment pieces might be worth the splurge for you. However, if you're trying to justify overspending or prioritize material possessions over other aspects of your life, it might be wise to reassess your priorities.\n\n**Your Givenchy gown from Neiman Marcus:**\n\nWhile it's understandable that you might have enjoyed the luxury and glamour of owning a high-end designer gown, it's great that you're now reflecting on your spending habits and prioritizing what truly adds value to your life. Perhaps you could consider alternative ways to experience luxury, such as renting or borrowing formal wear for special occasions.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be honest with yourself about your motivations and priorities when it comes to spending. By doing so, you'll make more intentional, value-aligned purchasing decisions that bring you joy and fulfillment in the long run.",

A week prior to that, I went to Trader Joe's with my sister and we spent around $75.

What do you think about the concept of \"investment pieces\" in fashion? Do you think they're worth the splurge, or are they just a way to justify overspending?",

Horizon Zero Dawn often goes on sale during these events, and you can get it at a discounted price.\n2. **Epic Games Store Sales**: The Epic Games Store also has regular sales, and Horizon Zero Dawn is available on their platform. You can check their store for discounts and promotions.\n3. **Summer Sales**: Both Steam and the Epic Games Store usually have large summer sales in June or July, where many games, including Horizon Zero Dawn, are discounted.\n4. **Black Friday and Cyber Monday**: These major shopping events in November often bring significant discounts on games, including Horizon Zero Dawn.\n5. **Bundle Deals**: Keep an eye out for bundle deals that include Horizon Zero Dawn and other games. These bundles can offer a discount compared to buying the game individually.\n6. **Price Tracking**: Use price tracking tools like SteamDB, IsThereAnyDeal, or PriceZombie to monitor the game's price history and receive alerts when it goes on sale.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a good deal, I recommend:\n\n* Following the game's social media accounts and developers for potential promotions\n* Subscribing to gaming news outlets and deal websites for updates on sales and discounts\n* Setting up price alerts for Horizon Zero Dawn on your preferred platform\n\nBy being patient and keeping an eye on these options, you should be able to snag Horizon Zero Dawn at a discounted price.
