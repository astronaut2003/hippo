I'd recommend getting it done **before** the music festival. Here's why:\n\n1. **Playability:** A serviced guitar will play better, sound better, and be more comfortable to play. You'll enjoy playing it more, and it'll be less likely to cause fatigue or discomfort during the festival.\n2. **Reliability:** A well-maintained guitar is less likely to malfunction or break during the festival. You don't want to risk having your guitar fail you in the middle of a jam session or performance!\n3. **Inspiration:** A freshly serviced guitar can spark inspiration and motivation. You might find yourself playing more, writing new songs, or experimenting with new techniques.\n4. **Festival vibes:** A music festival is all about good vibes, and having your guitar in top shape will contribute to that positive energy. You'll feel more confident, and your music will reflect that.\n\nGetting your guitar serviced before the festival will ensure you're ready to rock (or folk, or jazz, or...) with a well-maintained instrument. Plus, you'll have time to get familiar with any adjustments or changes made during the service.\n\nAfter the festival, you can focus on creating new music, inspired by the experiences and connections you made during the event. Who knows, you might even start producing some tracks with FL Studio!",

It's essential to be transparent about the condition of the case, so kudos to you for being honest.\n\nHere are a few additional tips to consider when listing your saxophone case on Craigslist:\n\n1. **Use relevant keywords**: Use keywords like \"saxophone case,\" \"alto sax case,\" \"hardshell case,\" or \"music gear\" to make it easier for people to find your listing.\n2. **Write a clear and concise description**: In addition to mentioning the condition and price, include any other relevant details, such as the case's brand, model, and size.\n3. **Set boundaries**: Consider adding a statement like \"no lowball offers, please\" or \"serious buyers only\" to discourage people from making unrealistic offers.\n4. **Be prepared for inquiries**: Be ready to respond to questions and messages from potential buyers in a timely manner.\n5. **Stay safe**: Remember to exercise caution when meeting potential buyers, especially if you're meeting in person. Choose a public place and tell a friend or family member about the meeting.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to find a buyer for your saxophone case quickly and efficiently.

Here are some tips to help you price your old saxophone case:\n\n1. **Research, research, research**: Look for similar saxophone cases online, both new and used, to get an idea of their market value. Check websites like eBay, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and specialized music gear marketplaces like Reverb or GearSwap.\n2. **Determine the condition**: Assess the condition of your case honestly. Is it in excellent, good, fair, or poor condition? Consider any scratches, dents, worn-out handles, or broken latches. The better the condition, the higher the price.\n3. **Check the brand and model**: If your case is from a well-known brand like Selmer, Yamaha, or Protec, it may hold more value than a generic or unknown brand. Research the specific model and its original price to determine a fair used price.\n4. **Consider the size and type**: Saxophone cases come in different sizes (alto, tenor, baritone, etc.) and types (hardshell, soft, gig bag, etc.). Larger or more specialized cases may be more valuable than smaller or more common ones.\n5. **Set a competitive price**: Based on your research, set a competitive price for your case. Keep in mind that you want to attract buyers, so don't overprice it. Consider starting with a slightly lower price to leave room for negotiation.\n6. **Add some context**: When listing your case for sale, include details like the case's age, any repairs or maintenance, and its original price (if you have the receipt). This can help build trust with potential buyers and justify your asking price.\n7. **Take clear photos**: Take high-quality, well-lit photos of the case from multiple angles. Show any flaws or damage to demonstrate transparency and build trust with potential buyers.\n8. **Be prepared to negotiate**: Be open to reasonable offers and negotiations. Consider bundling your case with other music-related items or offering a discount for a quick sale.\n\nSome general price ranges for used saxophone cases are:\n\n* Soft cases: $20-$100\n* Hardshell cases: $50-$300\n* Gig bags: $30-$150\n* High-end or specialty cases: $100-$500+\n\nRemember to stay realistic and flexible when pricing your saxophone case.
