Please provide the following information:\n\n1. How much did the service on February 10th cost?\n2. How often do you fill up on fuel, and approximately how much do you spend each time?\n3. Do you have a fixed insurance premium, and if so, how much is it?\n4. How much do you spend on registration and licensing annually or bi-annually?\n5.

Selling a vehicle can be a process, but it's great that you've had some interested buyers already.\n\nSince you're planning to sell the motorcycle, let's consider how this might impact your car budget. Once you sell the motorcycle, you might want to allocate the funds towards your car expenses or other priorities.\n\nHere are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Pay off car expenses**: You could use the proceeds from the motorcycle sale to pay off any outstanding car expenses, such as maintenance or repair costs.\n2. **Create a car maintenance fund**: You could set aside a portion of the funds as a dedicated car maintenance fund, which would help cover future maintenance and repair costs.\n3. **Apply to other expenses**: You might choose to allocate the funds towards other expenses, such as paying off debt, building an emergency fund, or saving for a specific goal.\n4. **Save for a new vehicle**: If you're planning to replace your current vehicle in the future, you could set aside the funds as a down payment or to help with financing costs.\n\nFor now, let's keep the motorcycle sale as a separate item, and we can revisit how to allocate the funds once the sale is complete.\n\nHere's an updated summary of your car budget and the motorcycle sale:\n\n**Car Budget:**\n\n* Regular Maintenance: $20.83/month\n* Fuel: $120/month\n* Wash and Detailing: $15/month\n* Insurance: $80/month\n* Registration and Licensing: ?
