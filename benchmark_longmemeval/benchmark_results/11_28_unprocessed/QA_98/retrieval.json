But I can give you some general recommendations:\n\n1. **The Metropolitan Museum of Art**: One of the world's largest and most famous museums, with a vast collection of art and artifacts from ancient civilizations, including Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art.\n2. **The Brooklyn Museum**: While not exclusively focused on ancient history, the Brooklyn Museum has an impressive collection of Egyptian, African, and Asian art, as well as a strong contemporary art program.\n3. **The Morgan Library & Museum**: This museum is located in a stunning neoclassical building and features a collection of rare books, manuscripts, and art from ancient to modern times, including works by artists like Michelangelo and Rembrandt.\n4. **The Cloisters**: A museum dedicated to medieval art and architecture, with a focus on European art and artifacts from the 12th to 15th centuries.

Here are some general suggestions:\n\n1. **Check the city's events calendar**: Look up the official website of the city or the city center's events calendar to see if there are any festivals, concerts, or street performances happening during your visit.\n2. **Popular landmarks and attractions**: Visit iconic landmarks, museums, and galleries that are often located in the city center. These can include historical buildings, monuments, or popular tourist spots.\n3. **Street performers and buskers**: City centers often have a lively atmosphere, and you might stumble upon street performers, musicians, or buskers. You might even find a juggler or two! Keep an eye out for them, and who knows, you might even meet another Jamie.\n4. **Food and drink**: City centers usually have a variety of restaurants, cafes, and food trucks serving local cuisine. Take a stroll and explore the different options to find something that suits your taste.\n5. **Shopping**: Many city centers have shopping districts or markets where you can find unique souvenirs, local products, or high-end brands.\n6. **Walking tours**: Consider taking a guided walking tour to explore the city center's history, architecture, and hidden gems.\n\nRemember to check the city's website or a mapping app like Google Maps to plan your route and get an idea of what's happening in the area during your visit.
