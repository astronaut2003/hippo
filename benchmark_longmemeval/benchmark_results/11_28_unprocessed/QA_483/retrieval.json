      "memory": "The opportunities for growth for FAEs in a startup company with less than 200 employees and a small product portfolio with no revenue would be somewhat different than those in a larger, more established company.\n\nIn a startup, the focus is often on building and growing the business, rather than on managing large teams or developing complex product lines. As a result, the opportunities for growth for FAEs may be more focused on contributing to the overall success of the company, rather than on advancing through specific career tracks.\n\nHere are a few possible growth opportunities for FAEs in a startup:\n\n1. Product development: FAEs in a startup may have the opportunity to play a key role in product development, helping to design and test new products and features. This could involve working closely with the company's founders and engineers to ensure that products meet customer needs and are technically feasible.\n2. Customer success: FAEs in a startup may also have the opportunity to work closely with customers, helping them to get the most value out of the company's products and services. This could involve providing technical support, troubleshooting issues, and developing relationships with key customers.\n3. Business development: FAEs in a startup may be able to contribute to the company's business development efforts, helping to identify new markets, partnerships, and revenue streams. This could involve conducting market research, attending industry events, and networking with potential customers and partners.\n4. Entrepreneurship: Finally, FAEs in a startup may have the opportunity to develop their own entrepreneurial skills, learning how to build and grow a successful business from the ground up. This could involve taking on leadership roles, developing new product ideas, and helping to shape the overall strategy of the company.\n\nOverall, the opportunities for growth for FAEs in a startup will depend on the specific needs and goals of the company, as well as the skills and interests of the individual FAE. However, in a startup environment, there is often more room for creativity and innovation, and FAEs may have the opportunity to make a significant impact on the company's success.",
