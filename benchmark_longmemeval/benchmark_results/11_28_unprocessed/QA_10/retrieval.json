If the contract had not provided for when the building works were complete and s 3B(1) was not engaged, then s 3B(2) and s 3B(3) of the HB Act would apply. It is not in dispute that the owners took possession of the works on 13 July 2017. In this case, that would be the relevant date in accordance with s 3B(3)(a) of the Act. Issue of the FOC is not the completion date of the works under s 3B.\nOverall, we conclude that the Tribunal erred in finding that the date of completion of the building works was 20 October 2010, when the FOC was issued. In making this finding, the Tribunal misinterpreted the contract and did not correctly apply sections 48K(7) and 3B of the HB Act. Ground 6 is established. In our view, if the completion date was not the date of practical completion (8 July 2010), it was the date on which the works were handed over the owners (13 July 2021).\nIf we have erred in finding that the Tribunal’s finding in relation to completion date raises a question of law, then for the reasons set out above, we conclude that the Tribunal’s finding in this regard is against the weight of evidence. We would grant leave to appeal on this ground because we consider that the Tribunal’s finding concerning the completion date gives rise to an injustice to the builder which is reasonably clear.\nDisposition of the appeal\nIt follows from our conclusion that the parties did not enter into a new contract or vary their original contract that the respondent’s application to the Tribunal was out of time. This is because the owners’ proceedings were not commenced within seven years of completion of the building works.\nThe Tribunal has no power to extend time for the making of an application under the HB Act: S & G Homes Pty Ltd t/as Pavilion Homes v Owen [2015] NSWCATAP 190 at [53].\nIn such circumstances, the appropriate orders are that the appeal be allowed, the decision under appeal be set aside and the Tribunal proceedings be dismissed.\nCosts of the Tribunal proceedings\nThe Tribunal formed what was expressed to be a “provisional view” that the builder should be ordered to pay the owners’ costs and made the following costs orders:\n4. Note the provisional view of the Tribunal that the\nrespondent builder pay the applicant owners' costs of\nPlease write in English language.",

Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Fruit and vegetables**: Set up a colorful arrangement of seasonal fruits or vegetables, like apples, oranges, grapes, or a bowl of tomatoes.\n2. **Vintage items**: Gather a collection of vintage items like old cameras, clocks, books, or antique trinkets to create a nostalgic and interesting composition.\n3. **Kitchenware**: Focus on a single item, like a beautiful ceramic vase, a tea set, or a copper pot, or create a still life with a mix of kitchen items, like a wooden spoon, a mortar and pestle, and a few spices.\n4. **Bottles and jars**: Set up a grouping of glass bottles, jars, or vases in different shapes and sizes, filled with flowers, branches, or simply left empty.\n5. **Musical instruments**: If you or someone in your household plays an instrument, consider painting a still life with a guitar, violin, or other instrument as the main subject.\n6. **Floral arrangements**: While you've already done sunflowers, you could explore other flower arrangements, like a bouquet of wildflowers, a single peony, or a branch of cherry blossoms.\n7. **Tea time**: Create a cozy still life with a teapot, cups, saucers, and a few sweet treats like cookies or macarons.\n8. **Books and papers**: Set up a still life with a stack of books, a few papers, and a reading lamp to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n9. **Personal treasures**: Gather a collection of personal items that hold sentimental value, like family heirlooms, jewelry, or mementos, to create a meaningful and introspective still life.\n10. **Everyday objects**: Take a closer look at everyday items like a pair of scissors, a sewing machine, or a collection of keys, and find the beauty in their shapes, textures, and forms.\n\nRemember, the key to a great still life painting is to find an arrangement that resonates with you and sparks your creativity. Experiment with different compositions, lighting setups, and color palettes to make your artwork unique and engaging.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create another beautiful still life painting!",

Combining meditation and yoga is a great way to cultivate a deeper sense of awareness and connection with your body and mind.\n\nIt's also great that you're reflecting on your experience at the Buddhist mindfulness retreat and wanting to continue exploring the teachings and principles in your daily life. Bhante Bodhi is a renowned teacher, and I'm sure you learned a lot from him.\n\nRemember that the key to making progress on the path of mindfulness and meditation is consistency and patience. It's not about achieving some kind of mystical state, but rather about cultivating a deeper sense of awareness and understanding of yourself and the world around you.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for how you can continue to explore the teachings and principles of Buddhism and mindfulness in your daily life:\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with short periods of meditation and mindfulness practice each day, and gradually increase the amount of time as you become more comfortable with the practice.\n2. **Make it a habit**: Try to make meditation and mindfulness a regular part of your daily routine, such as right after waking up or before bed.\n3. **Find a community**: Look for local meditation groups or mindfulness communities where you can connect with others who share your interest in these practices.\n4. **Read and learn**: Continue to read books and articles about Buddhism and mindfulness, and explore online resources such as podcasts and videos.\n5. **Reflect and journal**: Take time to reflect on your experiences and insights, and write them down in a journal to help you process and integrate them.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be gentle with yourself and approach these practices with an open and non-judgmental mind. Don't worry if you don't see immediate results or if your mind wanders during meditation - it's all part of the process.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful, and I wish you all the best on your journey of exploration and growth!",
