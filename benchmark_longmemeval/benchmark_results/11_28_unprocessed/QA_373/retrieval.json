In fact, having multiple bikes can be beneficial in several ways:\n\n1. **Variety:** Having different bikes allows you to experience different types of riding and explore various terrain, which can help prevent boredom and keep your rides fresh.\n2. **Specialization:** Each bike is optimized for its respective discipline, so you can focus on the specific demands of each type of riding.\n3. **Redundancy:** If one bike is in need of maintenance or repair, you can switch to another bike and minimize downtime.\n4. **Convenience:** Having a dedicated commuter bike, for example, can make your daily commutes more efficient and convenient.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the following:\n\n1. **Storage and maintenance:** With multiple bikes, you'll need to dedicate space for storage and maintenance, which can be time-consuming and costly.\n2. **Cost:** Owning multiple bikes can be expensive, especially if you're constantly upgrading or replacing components.\n3. **Overlap:** If you find that you're not using one of your bikes regularly, it might be worth considering selling or upgrading to a bike that better suits your needs.\n\n**Tips for Managing Multiple Bikes:**\n\n1. **Designate a \"primary\" bike:** Identify your most-used bike and prioritize its maintenance and upgrades.\n2. **Rotate maintenance:** Schedule regular maintenance for each bike to ensure they're all in good condition.\n3. **Keep a \"bike journal\":** Track your rides, maintenance, and upgrades for each bike to stay organized and identify patterns or issues.\n4. **Consider a \"bike budget\":** Set aside a budget for bike-related expenses, including maintenance, upgrades, and accessories.\n\n**Century Ride Preparation:**\n\nSince you're planning to use your road bike for the century ride, make sure to focus on its maintenance and preparation. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Tune-up:** Get your road bike serviced by a professional mechanic to ensure it's in top condition.\n2. **Component check:** Inspect your bike's components, such as tires, chain, and brake pads, and replace them if necessary.\n3. **Fit and comfort:** Make sure your road bike is properly fitted to your body, and consider upgrading components like the saddle or handlebars for added comfort.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well-prepared for your century ride and can enjoy your multiple bikes without feeling overwhelmed.",

Having four bikes will definitely add an extra layer of complexity to your trip, but it'll be worth it to experience the varying landscapes and cycling styles.\n\nConsidering you'll have multiple bikes, I recommend taking some extra precautions to ensure their safety and security during the trip:\n\n1. **Bike storage:** As you mentioned, booking accommodations with bike storage is crucial. Be sure to confirm with each hotel or resort that they can accommodate all four bikes. You might need to make special arrangements or request a larger storage room.\n2. **Bike covers and locks:** Invest in high-quality bike covers or bags to protect your bikes during transport. Bring multiple locks and chains to secure your bikes when they're not in use. This will give you peace of mind, especially when stopping at restaurants, attractions, or taking breaks.\n3. **Bike maintenance:** Since you'll have multiple bikes, it's essential to perform regular maintenance checks to ensure they're in good working condition. Bring a basic tool kit, spare tubes, and a pump to make any necessary adjustments or repairs.\n4. **Vehicle storage:** With four bikes, you'll need a vehicle that can accommodate them safely. Consider investing in a bike rack or trailer that can hold all four bikes. Make sure the rack or trailer is sturdy and securely attached to your vehicle.\n5. **Parking and loading:** When stopping at attractions or accommodations, be mindful of parking and loading areas. Look for designated bike parking or areas with minimal foot traffic to reduce the risk of damage or theft.\n\nTo make the most of your trip, I recommend allocating time for each bike, depending on the terrain and route. This will allow you to experience the unique characteristics of each bike and enjoy the varied landscapes.\n\nLastly, don't forget to take plenty of photos and share your adventure with fellow cycling enthusiasts!",
