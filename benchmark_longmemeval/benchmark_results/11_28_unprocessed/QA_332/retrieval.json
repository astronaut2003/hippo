Here are a few apps from my previous list that might suit your needs:\n\n1. **Todoist**: Todoist is a great choice if you want a straightforward, no-frills task management app. It's easy to use, and you can quickly add tasks, set reminders, and track your progress. Todoist also has a \"Dark Mode\" feature, which can help reduce screen brightness and make it easier to use before bed.\n2. **Any.do**: Any.do is another user-friendly app that's easy to navigate. It has a clean design, and you can customize your task lists with different colors and themes. Any.do also has a \"Night Mode\" feature, which adjusts the screen brightness and color scheme to reduce eye strain.\n3. **Trello**: Trello is a visual app that uses boards, lists, and cards to organize your tasks. It's a great choice if you're a visual person and enjoy moving tasks around to prioritize them. Trello also has a \"Night Mode\" feature, and you can customize your boards with different backgrounds and stickers to make it more appealing.\n\nIf you're concerned about screen time before bed, you might consider using an app that has a companion watch app or allows you to access your tasks through voice commands. This way, you can quickly check your tasks or add new ones without having to stare at a screen.\n\n**Todoist** has a watch app for both Apple Watch and Wear OS, allowing you to view your tasks, set reminders, and even dictate new tasks using voice commands.\n\n**Any.do** has a watch app for Apple Watch and offers voice commands through Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa integrations.\n\n**Trello** has a watch app for Apple Watch, but it's more limited in its features compared to Todoist and Any.do.\n\nUltimately, the best app for you will depend on your personal preferences and workflow. You might consider trying out a few of these apps to see which one feels most comfortable and intuitive to you.\n\nHappy reading (and organizing)!",

This line is quite unexpected because it is a metaphor and doesn't seem to be fitting with the other lyrics in the song. The lyrics are primarily focused on the monotony of daily life, fear and violence, and dreams and nightmares, the theme of \"razors in my bed\" is not clearly connected with any of those themes, but it seems to be a metaphor for something else. Without more context, it's hard to say what exactly the metaphor is intended to represent, but it certainly adds a level of intrigue and mystery to the song.",
