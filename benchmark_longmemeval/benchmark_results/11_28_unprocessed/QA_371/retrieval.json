However, I can provide some general guidance.\n\nTypically, airline vouchers can be used to book a one-way or round-trip ticket, but it depends on the voucher's terms and conditions. Some vouchers might be restricted to round-trip bookings only, while others might allow one-way bookings.\n\nTo clarify, I recommend checking the following:\n\n1. The voucher itself: Look for any fine print or restrictions mentioned on the voucher.\n2. The airline's website: Check the airline's website, especially the section on vouchers or gift cards, to see if they have any specific policies or restrictions on using vouchers for one-way or round-trip bookings.\n3. Contact the airline: Reach out to the airline's customer service department directly and ask about the voucher's terms and conditions. They can provide you with the most up-to-date and accurate information.\n\nWhen you contact the airline, be prepared to provide the voucher number and any other relevant details. They'll be able to inform you about any restrictions or limitations on using the voucher for a one-way ticket to Denver or Las Vegas.\n\nRemember to also check the voucher's expiration date and any blackout dates that might apply. You'll want to make sure you can use the voucher before it expires and that it's valid for the travel dates you're planning.",
