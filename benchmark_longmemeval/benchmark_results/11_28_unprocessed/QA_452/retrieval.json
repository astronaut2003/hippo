Sexual impulsivity - This term emphasizes the impulsive or compulsive nature of certain sexual behaviors and the difficulties individuals may face in controlling them.\n4. Compulsive sexuality - This phrase emphasizes the compulsive nature of certain sexual behaviors and the difficulties individuals may face in breaking free from them.\n\nI hope these suggestions are more helpful for you.",

Your revised response is perfect.\n\nYou're absolutely right, Freedom's Scheduled blocks allow you to create custom block lists and schedules that cater to your specific needs and goals. By blocking social media during certain times of the day or week, you can reduce distractions and stay focused on more important tasks.\n\nYour example is a great illustration of how this feature can be used in a practical way. By blocking social media from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, you can avoid mindless scrolling during your morning routine and stay focused on your work or studies. Meanwhile, allowing access to email, news, and productivity tools ensures that you can still stay connected and productive during that time.\n\nThanks for providing a clear and concise explanation!

Both are great habits that can have a significant impact on your well-being and the planet.\n\nFor all-purpose cleaners, I've got some fantastic recommendations that are gentle on surfaces and the environment:\n\n1. **Seventh Generation**: This brand offers a wide range of plant-based, biodegradable, and non-toxic cleaning products. Their all-purpose cleaners are effective and gentle on surfaces. Look for their \"Disinfecting All-Purpose Cleaner\" or \"Natural All-Purpose Cleaner.\"\n2. **Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds**: This is a versatile, concentrated cleaner that can be used for a variety of tasks, from cleaning countertops to washing dishes. It's made from natural ingredients, biodegradable, and free of synthetic fragrances and dyes.\n3. **Ecover**: This eco-friendly brand offers a range of all-purpose cleaners that are gentle on surfaces and the environment. Their products are made from natural and biodegradable ingredients, and they're free of phosphates, chlorine, and other harsh chemicals.\n4. **Method Squirt + Mop All-Purpose Cleaner**: Method is a popular eco-friendly brand that offers a range of cleaning products. Their all-purpose cleaner is gentle on surfaces, non-toxic, and biodegradable. Plus, it's fragrance-free, making it suitable for those with sensitivities.\n5. **White vinegar and water**: If you're looking for a DIY solution, mixing white vinegar and water is a simple and effective all-purpose cleaner. The acidity in vinegar makes it a natural disinfectant, and it's gentle on most surfaces.\n\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly cleaning products, be sure to check the labels for certifications like EPA Safer Choice, Leaping Bunny, or cruelty-free logos, which ensure the products meet certain environmental and animal welfare standards.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your daily cleaning routine is having a positive impact on your mental clarity and productivity! Consistency is key, and it's amazing how a tidy space can boost your mood and energy levels. Keep up the good work, and happy cleaning!",
