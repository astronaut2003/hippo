Madeline Miller's writing is so evocative and immersive that it's easy to get lost in the story, even in short sessions.\n\nYou're about halfway through, which means you're probably getting to the more intense and emotional parts of the story. Be prepared to have your heart strings pulled, because Miller's writing can be quite affecting.\n\nFinishing the book by the end of the month is a great goal, and I'm sure you'll be able to achieve it. Take your time, though, and savor the experience. The story is worth lingering over, and the characters will stay with you long after you finish the book.\n\nWhat do you think of Patroclus and Achilles' relationship so far? Have you noticed how Miller weaves together the mythological and historical elements with the characters' personal stories?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts, and I'll be happy to discuss the book with you!",
