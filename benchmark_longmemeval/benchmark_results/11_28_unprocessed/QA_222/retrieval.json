This can be confirmed by substituting 12 for x in the original equation:\n\n12/2 + 5 = 11\n6 + 5 = 11\n11 = 11\n\nSo the solution x = 12 satisfies the equation.",

Here is a combined table showing the age-based demographics for China, the United States, and India by residential area:\n\n| Age Group | China Total | China Urban | China Rural | US Total | US Urban | US Rural | US Suburban | India Total | India Rural | India Urban |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 17.95% | 15.29% | 21.12% | 22.2% | 23.8% | 20.0% | 22.3% | 28.5% | 29.6% | 25.7% |\n| 15-59 | 70.59% | 76.51% | 66.31% | 62.5% | 62.5% | 62.5% | 63.0% | 63.5% | 62.5% | 67.6% |\n| 60+ | 11.46% | 8.20% | 12.57% | 15.4% | 13.6% | 17.4% | 14.8% | 8.0% | 7.9% | 6.7% |\n\nNote that the \"suburban\" category is only included for the US, as it is a commonly used residential category in the country. Also, note that the data for China is based on the latest census conducted in 2020, while the data for the US is based on the 2019 American Community Survey, and the data for India is based on the 2011 Census of India. The data may have changed slightly since these surveys were conducted.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
