Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently scrub away dirt and stains.\n3. **Damp cloth**: Use a damp cloth to wipe away dirt and soap residue. Avoid soaking the sneakers or using harsh chemicals.\n4. **Baking soda and vinegar**: For tougher stains, mix baking soda and vinegar to create a paste. Apply it to the stain, let it sit for 30 minutes, and then rinse with cold water.\n5. **Let them air dry**: Allow the sneakers to air dry completely, away from direct sunlight.\n\n**When to Take Them to a Professional:**\n\n1. **Tough stains**: If you're dealing with tough stains or scuff marks, a professional cleaner may have the necessary expertise and equipment to remove them.\n2. **Delicate materials**: If your sneakers have delicate materials, such as suede or nubuck, it's best to take them to a professional to avoid damaging the material.\n3. **Specialized cleaning**: Some sneakers, like those with waterproof or Gore-Tex membranes, may require specialized cleaning products and techniques that a professional can provide.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Act quickly**: The sooner you clean your sneakers, the better.

Cleaning them properly will help maintain their appearance, extend their lifespan, and even prevent odors. Here are some shoe cleaning tips to get your kicks looking fresh again:\n\n1. **Remove loose dirt and debris**: Start by gently brushing off any loose dirt, dust, or debris from the surface of the shoes using a soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth.\n2. **Identify the material**: Check the shoe's material to determine the best cleaning method. Most sneakers are made of leather, synthetic materials, or a combination of both.\n3. **Use a gentle cleaning solution**: For general cleaning, mix a solution of warm water and mild soap, such as dish soap or hand soap. Dip a clean cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and gently wipe down the shoes. Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or excessive water, as they can damage the materials.\n4. **Tackle tough stains**: For tough stains, you can use a specialized shoe cleaner or a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar. Apply the solution to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe clean with a damp cloth.\n5. **Use a shoe cleaning brush**: For more stubborn stains or dirt buildup, use a shoe cleaning brush to gently scrub the area. Be gentle, as you don't want to damage the materials.\n6. **Dry the shoes**: Use a clean, dry cloth to blot the shoes and remove any excess moisture. You can also use a fan or a hair dryer on a low setting to speed up the drying process.\n7. **Condition and protect**: Once the shoes are dry, apply a shoe conditioner or protector to keep the materials supple and protected from future stains.\n\nSome additional tips:\n\n* Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or excessive water, as they can damage the materials or discolor the shoes.\n* Don't put your shoes in the washing machine or dryer, as this can cause damage or shrinkage.\n* For tough odors, sprinkle baking soda or odor-absorbing insoles inside the shoes and let them sit overnight before cleaning.\n* Regularly cleaning your shoes can help prevent dirt and stains from building up in the future.\n\nI hope these tips help you get your sneakers looking fresh and clean again!",

This can help the shoes regain their original fit and feel.\n6. **Try the freezer trick**: Place the shoes in the freezer for a few hours. The cold temperature can help contract the materials, which may help them return to their original shape. However, be cautious when using this method, as it may not work for all materials.\n\nRemember to be patient and gentle when trying to restore your Vans to their original shape.

I think he might have stretched them out or something. Do you have any tips on how to restore them to their original fit?",
