However, it's still essential to take action to try to recover your money and protect yourself from potential fraud.\n\nBefore contacting Sakura Travel Agency again, I would recommend taking a step back and assessing the situation. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Verify the agency's legitimacy**: Try to find more information about Sakura Travel Agency, such as their physical address, phone number, and email address. Check if they have a professional website, social media presence, or any online reviews.\n2. **Check for red flags**: Look for signs of a potential scam, such as poor communication, lack of transparency, or unprofessional behavior.\n3. **Review your communication**: Go through your email or message history with Sakura Travel Agency. Check if they provided any concrete details about your trip, such as flight numbers, hotel reservations, or itinerary.\n\nIf you're still unsure about the agency's legitimacy or have concerns about your trip, I would advise against contacting them again. Instead, consider the following options:\n\n1. **Contact your bank**: Reach out to your bank to report the incident and ask if they can help you trace the payment or provide any assistance.\n2. **Report to the authorities**: File a report with your local authorities, such as the police or consumer protection agency, to report the potential fraud.\n3. **Seek help from a travel expert**: Consult with a reputable travel agency or a travel expert who can help you plan your trip to Japan and book your flights and accommodations safely.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with unfamiliar companies, especially when it comes to financial transactions.\n\nIf you do decide to contact Sakura Travel Agency again, be cautious and don't provide any additional personal or financial information. Instead, ask specific questions about your trip, such as:\n\n* Can you provide the flight numbers and booking references for my tickets?\n* Can you confirm the hotel reservations and accommodation details?\n* Can you give me a detailed itinerary for my trip?\n\nBe prepared for the possibility that Sakura Travel Agency might not respond or provide unsatisfactory answers.

This will give you a more comprehensive understanding of the insurer's reputation and service.\n\nRemember, the cheapest option might not always be the best. Be sure to weigh the cost against the coverage and benefits provided.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could also consider consulting with a licensed insurance agent or broker who specializes in travel insurance.
