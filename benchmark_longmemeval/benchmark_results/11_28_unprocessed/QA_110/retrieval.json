Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Traffic:** Highway 1 can be busy, especially on weekends and during peak tourist season. However, the road is wide enough to accommodate cyclists, and most drivers are accustomed to sharing the road with bikes. You'll encounter a mix of local traffic, tourists, and commuters, but the traffic flow is usually moderate.\n\n**Road Condition:** The road surface on Highway 1 is generally good, with some sections having been repaved in recent years. You'll encounter some rough patches, but they're manageable. Be aware of the occasional pothole, crack, or debris, especially after winter storms.\n\n**Bike-Friendliness:** While there are no dedicated bike lanes on Highway 1, the road has a wide shoulder or a bike lane in many sections. The speed limit is 45-55 mph, which allows for a comfortable pace for cyclists. There are also several bike-friendly features, such as:\n\n* Wide shoulders: Many sections of Highway 1 have wide shoulders, ranging from 2-4 feet, providing a buffer between you and traffic.\n* Bike lanes: Some sections, like the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge, have dedicated bike lanes.\n* Bike-friendly intersections: Many intersections have bike lanes or shared lanes, making it easier to navigate.\n\n**Tips for riding on Highway 1:**\n\n1. **Ride defensively:** Be aware of your surroundings, and anticipate the actions of motorists.\n2. **Follow traffic rules:** Obey traffic laws, including stopping at stop signs and red lights.\n3. **Use hand signals:** Signal your intentions to turn or change lanes to communicate with motorists.\n4. **Ride in a group:** If possible, ride with a group or a buddy to increase visibility and safety.\n5. **Be prepared:** Bring necessary tools, snacks, and water, as services can be limited along the route.\n\n**Golden Gate Bridge:** The Golden Gate Bridge is a unique experience, with stunning views of the San Francisco Bay and the city skyline. The bridge has a dedicated bike and pedestrian path on the eastern side, which is separated from the roadway by a barrier. The path is about 10 feet wide, and you'll need to walk your bike on the bridge's approach ramps. Be prepared for strong winds, especially in the afternoon.\n\nOverall, Highway 1 is a great route for cyclists, offering stunning views and a fun, challenging ride. With some basic precautions and awareness, you'll be able to enjoy this iconic route safely.",

The plan involves rolling out changes in one data center at a time to ensure that the system remains operational while updates are made. The final step involves switching to load balanced traffic to ensure that the system can handle traffic from both data centers. It's crucial to monitor the system after deployment to ensure that everything is running smoothly and to quickly address any issues that arise.",
