It could have glowing green eyes, an emaciated body with patches of fur falling out, and possibly even some kind of glowing aura around it.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the Radiation Amplified could emit a toxic aura that damages players over time if they get too close, similar to the Nova Gas zombies from Black Ops. Additionally, its attacks could have a chance to inflict radiation poisoning on the player, causing their screen to distort and blur similar to Cosmic Cleanse, but in a way that's more disorienting and harder to see through.\n\nAs for a name, how about \"Radialisk\"? It's a play on words between \"radial\" (as in radiation) and \"hydralisk\" (a creature from the Starcraft game series), which could give the zombie a sci-fi feel to fit with the radiation theme.",

The skin itself could have a sickly green tint, as if it's being irradiated from within.\n* The parasite could be visible under the skin, writhing and pulsating in a disturbing way. It could be slimy and amorphous, constantly shifting and changing shape.\n* The host's eyes could be milky and glazed over, or maybe they're glowing with an eerie green light.\n* The Fissionator could have a hunched, lurching gait, as if its mutated body is too heavy to move properly.\n* Its movements could be jerky and spasmodic, as if it's in constant pain.\n* It could emit a low, guttural growl, or maybe it makes no noise at all aside from the sound of its heavy breathing.\n\nAs for the radiation effects, here are some ideas for how that could manifest:\n\n* The Fissionator could leave a trail of green, glowing slime wherever it goes. This slime could be dangerous to touch, causing radiation damage over time.\n* Its attacks could leave a lingering radiation field in their wake, causing damage to anyone standing in the affected area.\n* On death, the Fissionator could explode in a burst of radiation that transforms nearby zombies into radioactive ones, as you mentioned earlier.\n* Maybe its radiation effects are powerful enough to even affect the environment itself, causing objects to become irradiated and dangerous to touch.\n\nI hope these ideas help!",

This would also give an extra purpose to the vision-distortion it causes; not only is it a hindrance to the player, it's also a warning to not get any closer without risking your life. Perhaps the AoE damage would be nullified by Cosmic Cleanse, bht the vision effect would only be partially negated, leaving some of the challenge present if you get too close.\n\nAs for the Fissionator's attacks, I like the idea of them causing radiation poisoning! Maybe to add to this, the Fissionators death causes a radioactive burst that turns zombies into radioactive ones, upping their damage and making them, too, give the radiation effect when they attack the player. To signal this, maybe they could get a light green glow and you could see the slime-parasite within the host body reacting violently to the sudden radiation exposure",

A humanoid figure wearing a bulky, outdated radiation suit, with a tank of radioactive material on its back. The suit could have a rusty, industrial look to it, with warning symbols and labels all over.\n2. A large, mutated creature that resembles a cross between a gorilla and a turtle, with a tough, scaly shell on its back. The shell could be covered in glowing, radioactive crystals that emit a faint green light.\n3. A robotic construct that resembles a cross between a tank and a spider, with multiple legs and a large, glowing core at its center. The core could emit radiation in a wide area, and the legs could allow it to move slowly but steadily towards the player.\n4. A massive, rusted-out vehicle that has been converted into a makeshift radiation cannon. The vehicle could be stationary, but would fire off bursts of radiation that slowly move towards the player, forcing them to constantly adjust their position.\n\nHope these ideas help!",

Here's what you need to know:\n\n**What's the same:**\n\n* Both shows are set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by walkers (zombies)\n* Both series focus on human characters and their struggles to survive in a world gone mad\n* Both shows have a strong emphasis on character development, relationships, and drama\n\n**What's different:**\n\n* **Setting:** \"Fear the Walking Dead\" takes place in Los Angeles, California, whereas \"The Walking Dead\" is set in the southeastern United States (Georgia and Virginia)\n* **Timeframe:** \"Fear the Walking Dead\" starts at the beginning of the zombie outbreak, showing the early days of chaos and confusion, whereas \"The Walking Dead\" takes place several months or years after the outbreak\n* **Tone:** \"Fear the Walking Dead\" has a slightly different tone, with a greater emphasis on family dynamics, social commentary, and the initial shock and panic of the apocalypse\n* **Characters:** While both shows have diverse characters, \"Fear the Walking Dead\" focuses on a blended family, the Clarks, and their struggles to stay together and survive in a rapidly deteriorating world\n* **Pace:** \"Fear the Walking Dead\" has a slightly slower pace than \"The Walking Dead,\" with a greater focus on building tension and suspense as the characters navigate the early days of the apocalypse\n\n**Storyline:**\n\nThe show follows the Clark family, consisting of high school guidance counselor Madison (Kim Dickens), her boyfriend Travis (Cliff Curtis), her son Nick (Frank Dillane), and her daughter Alicia (Alycia Debnam-Carey). As the zombie outbreak spreads, the family must band together to survive and find a way to escape the chaos in Los Angeles.\n\n**How it relates to \"The Walking Dead\":**\n\nWhile \"Fear the Walking Dead\" is a spin-off, it's not directly connected to the original series in terms of characters or storylines. However, both shows share the same universe and rules for the walkers. You might notice some Easter eggs or nods to the original series, but \"Fear the Walking Dead\" stands on its own as a unique story.\n\n**Where to watch:**\n\nYou can stream \"Fear the Walking Dead\" on AMC, Amazon Prime Video, or purchase individual episodes/seasons on platforms like iTunes or Google Play.\n\nI hope this helps!
