It's a classic film that's known for its flexibility and versatility, and it's a great choice for beginners and experienced photographers alike. And developing your own film at home is a great way to add an extra layer of control and creativity to your process.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're experimenting with different subjects and styles. Portraits, street scenes, and landscapes are all great ways to capture the essence of everyday life, and still life photography can be a wonderful way to showcase your collections and interests.\n\nI completely agree with you about the process of shooting with film. It's a much more deliberate and intentional process than digital photography, and it requires a certain level of patience and attention to detail. But the rewards are well worth it - there's something special about holding a physical print in your hands, and knowing that you've created something unique and tangible.\n\nI think that's one of the things that I love about film photography - it's a process that requires a certain level of craftsmanship and attention to detail, but it also allows for a level of serendipity and unpredictability that can be really exciting. You never quite know how your shots are going to turn out, and that can be a really liberating experience.\n\nDo you have any plans to share your photography with a wider audience, or is it more of a personal hobby for you?",
