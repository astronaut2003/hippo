Serve the lentil bolognese over quinoa, with roasted vegetables, or as a sauce for pasta or veggies.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a mixture of lentil types, such as green, brown, and red, for a more complex flavor profile.\n* Add other aromatics like bay leaves, thyme, or rosemary to the pot for added depth.\n* For a richer flavor, add 1-2 tbsp tomato paste to the pot before adding the crushed tomatoes.\n* Experiment with different types of mushrooms, such as porcini or cremini, for varying textures and flavors.\n* Make it a one-pot meal by adding your favorite vegetables, like bell peppers or zucchini, to the pot during the last 10 minutes of simmering.\n\nGive this recipe a try, and I hope you'll enjoy the rich, savory flavor of lentil bolognese!",
