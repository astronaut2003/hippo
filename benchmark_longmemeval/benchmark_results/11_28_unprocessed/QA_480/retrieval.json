However, some common challenging experiences while learning a new language in a foreign country are:\n\n1) Language Barrier: When a student doesn't have sufficient knowledge of the local language, communicating with natives and understanding the lesson becomes difficult.\n\n2) Cultural Differences: Understanding the cultural context of a language is crucial, and it becomes challenging for learners to comprehend the language nuances without knowing its cultural background.\n\n3) Lack of Practice: Learning a language requires practice, and not using the language regularly hampers the learner's progress.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, one can try the following:\n\n1) Enroll in language programs: Joining language programs can help in understanding the language better, and practicing with native speakers can improve communication skills.\n\n2) Immersion: Living in the local community of the foreign country can help in understanding the culture and language better.\n\n3) Practice: Practice with language partners, watch native language movies, read books, and surround oneself with the language.",

It's a great game for social interaction and strategic planning.\n2. **Pandemic**: Work together to save the world from diseases! This cooperative game is all about teamwork, strategy, and time management.\n3. **Carcassonne**: A tile-laying game where you build a medieval landscape, placing tiles to create cities, roads, and fields. Easy to learn, but with depth for strategy.\n\n**New Experiences:**\n\n1. **Codenames**: A word-guessing game where one player gives one-word clues that relate to multiple words on a grid. Great for teams and encourages creative thinking.\n2. **Mysterium**: A cooperative game where one player takes on the role of a ghost trying to communicate with the other players (psychic mediums) to solve a murder mystery.\n3. **Azul**: A strategic game where players compete to create the most beautiful mosaic by collecting and placing tiles. Easy to learn, but with depth for replayability.\n\n**Party Games:**\n\n1. **Taboo**: A fast-paced word-describing game where players take turns explaining a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases.\n2. **Deception**: A social deduction game where one player takes on the role of a spy, and the others must figure out who it is through a series of questions and accusations.\n3. **Wits & Wagers**: A trivia game where players bet on the answers given by their opponents, making it a fun and social experience.\n\n**Other Recommendations:**\n\n1. **7 Wonders**: A card-drafting game where players build up their civilization by collecting cards that represent different structures, technologies, and military units.\n2. **Forbidden Island/Forbidden Desert**: A cooperative game where players work together to retrieve four treasures from an island/desert before it sinks/gets buried in sand.\n3. **Qwirkle**: A tile-matching game where players try to create lines of matching colors and shapes.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many more games out there.
