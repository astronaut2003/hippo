(0.8 miles from 98122, 15-minute walk or 5-minute drive)\n2. **Queen Anne Cafe**: A breakfast and lunch spot with a relaxed vibe, offering omelets, pancakes, and sandwiches. (0.9 miles from 98122, 17-minute walk or 5-minute drive)\n3. **El Chupacabra**: A casual Mexican restaurant with a fun atmosphere, serving tacos, burritos, and more. (1.1 miles from 98122, 20-minute walk or 6-minute drive)\n4. **The Other Coast Cafe**: A laid-back cafe serving sandwiches, salads, and soups, with a focus on local ingredients. (1.2 miles from 98122, 22-minute walk or 7-minute drive)\n5. **Zeek's Pizza**: A casual pizzeria with a relaxed atmosphere, offering a variety of specialty pies and salads. (1.3 miles from 98122, 24-minute walk or 8-minute drive)\n\nConsidering your dance class starts at 2 PM, and it takes 20 minutes to get to the studio from your apartment, I'd recommend planning to leave your apartment around 12:10 PM to grab lunch at one of these spots. This should give you enough time to eat and get to the studio with a few minutes to spare.\n\nWhich of these options sounds appealing to you, or would you like more recommendations?",
