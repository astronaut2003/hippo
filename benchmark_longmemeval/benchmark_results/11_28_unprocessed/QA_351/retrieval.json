But today, we are here to honor a special member of our team. A young man who, through his bravery and quick thinking, gave us the opening we needed to win.\"\n\nThe crowd cheered, and Wukong turned to Ao Lie. \"Ao Lie, step forward,\" he said, his voice ringing out across the square.\n\nAo Lie stepped forward nervously, his heart pounding in his chest. He looked out at the sea of faces before him and felt a wave of emotion wash over him.\n\n\"Ao Lie,\" Macaque called out, \"you picked up that vial of peppermint oil and threw it right into Spider Queen's face. You gave us the chance we needed to defeat her once and for all.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers, and Ao Lie felt his face flush with pride.\n\n\"You are a true hero,\" Bai Long Ma added, a smile spreading across his face.\n\nAo Lie looked out at the crowd once more and felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before. He had always felt like an outsider, but here, among these people, he felt like he belonged.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Thank you for giving me a chance to be a part of something bigger than myself.\"\n\nThe crowd cheered once more, and Ao Lie felt like he could conquer the world.
