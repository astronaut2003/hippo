The Tribunal dealt with the 19 July 2017 letter as one part of a course of conduct (which included the builder’s correspondence) that led the Tribunal to conclude that there was an agreement between the parties. Furthermore, we note that in its post-hearing submissions the builder did not specifically cite Butler v Fairclough. Rather, it cited Haller, which the Tribunal in turn cited at [20] of the Reasons. The Tribunal was not obliged to give any more detailed reasons than were provided.\nGrounds 6 and 7 - Completion date\nThe issues to be considered in respect of these grounds are whether the Tribunal made an error of law in finding that the completion date of the works undertaken pursuant to the parties’ 2009 contract was 20 October 2010 (Ground 6). This ground involves the proper construction of the contract, which is a question of law. Leave to appeal is not required in respect of Ground 6.\nThe issue in Ground 7 is whether leave to appeal should be granted on the basis that the Tribunal’s finding concerning the completion date was against the weight of evidence.\nTribunal’s finding\nIn relation to completion date, the Tribunal stated:\nThe owners argued that practical completion under the original contract took place on 20 October 2010 when the FOC issued. I agree respectfully with the thrust of the owners' submission in this respect. The \"building works\" as defined in cl 1.1 of the original contract meant \"the building works to be carried out, completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations\" (emphasis added), \"contract documents\" meant the general and special conditions and the plans, the specifications and other documents specified in Item 14 of Schedule 1, Sch 1 headed \"Particulars of Contracts\" was part of the contract, Sch 1 para 11 said that the builder was the person to obtain and pay for all planning and building approvals (which was the default position if a party was not, unlike here, expressly named), clause 7.1 said that the party named in item 11 must obtain and pay for all building and planning approvals, which necessarily included them in the contract price, the FOC is a planning and building approval because it approves lawful occupation on the basis of conformity of the physical structure with preceding approvals, and cll 26.2(c) to 26.7 with cl 15 required the final progress claim out of the contract price to be demanded and paid on, and only on, practical completion.\nMoreover, as a further but not necessary supporting basis for the conclusion, the first emphasised words in the definition of \"building works\" indicate that the physical works are of no use to the owner to possess, even if physical possession of them is given by giving of keys, unless they are legally approved for occupation by the owner. This last point is reinforced by the definition in cl 1.1 of \"practical completion\" which focuses on completeness except for matters not preventing use for usual purpose; such use cannot be present without the approval to occupy.\nFinally, and as a further but not necessary supporting argument, the second emphasised words in the definition of \"building works\" arguably cover the written variation to the original contract constituted by the terms of the builder's letter, although I note that I have \nPlease write in English language.",

      "memory": "Part 30 not relied upon this basis because the terms of cl 17 of the original contract for variations were not precisely followed or, arguably, apposite in some aspects.\nIf I am wrong on my preference for the owners' argument on practical completion date - because, for instance, it is accepted that the ordinary meaning of building works within the contract definition and within the definition of \"practical completion\" is the physical work, this is reinforced by \"handed over\" and governs \"completion\", or it is said that the owners did not use the mechanism in cl 26.3 to defer practical completion until issue of the FOC - then I would accept the thrust of the owners' submission on the meaning of \"completion\" under the contract (as opposed to \"practical completion\") to the following extent. The builder's obligations under the contract (irrespective of the definition and meaning of \"building works\", \"date of practical completion\" and \"practical completion\") were not complete at least until the owners received the FOC as part of planning and building approvals under item 11 in Sch 1; that provides the date that work is complete within the meaning of the original contract (a date is not required, just a specified activity) on the proper interpretation of the contract and also within the meaning of HBA s 3B(1). Accordingly, s 3B(2) and (3) have no work to do because s 3B(2) operates when s 3B(1) is not operative and s 3B(3) is parasitic on s 3B(2) because it requires a context of practical completion for the presumption about practical completion to operate.\nConclusion on grounds 6 and 7\nIn summary, the Tribunal’s reasoning process in relation to completion date was:\nThe builder was responsible for obtaining the FOC;\nThe builder’s obligation to provide the FOC fell within the definition of “building works” under the contract\nCompletion of the works occurred within the meaning of the contract and therefore for the purposes of s 3B(1) of the HB Act upon the owners’ receipt of the Final Occupation Certificate (FOC);\nThe Tribunal’s finding in this respect is relevant to its finding that there was consideration in respect of the new contract it found that the parties had entered into. Given our findings in respect of Grounds 2 and 3, it is not strictly necessary for us to consider this ground, but we do so for completeness.\nWe conclude that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of relevant terms of the contract.\nFor this purpose we set out the relevant clauses of the contract, which is a standard form Housing Industry Association (HIA) contract.\nClause 1 of the contract defines “building works” as:\nThe building works to be carried out, completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations.\nIn accordance with clause 1, “practical completion” means:\nWhen the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose.\nClause 7 of the contract is headed “Planning and Building Approvals”. Clause 7.1states:\n7.1 The party named in Item 11 of Schedule 1 must obtain and pay for all building and planning approvals.\nItem 11 names the builder as the responsible party for the purposes of clause 7.\nPlease write in English language.",

The definition of “building works” is clear and refers to physical works, including variations. The FOC, while a crucial component of obtaining planning and building approvals, is not part of the physical works themselves. Clause 7.1 of the contract places the responsibility for obtaining and paying for all building and planning approvals on the builder, but this does not mean that the obtaining of approvals is part of the building works themselves.\nWe also do not accept the Tribunal’s finding that completion of the works occurred for the purposes of s 3B(1) of the HB Act upon the owners’ receipt of the FOC. The definition of “practical completion” in the contract specifically provides that the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. The receipt of the FOC is not necessary for the building works to be reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. While the FOC is a necessary component of obtaining planning and building approvals, it is not a necessary component of practical completion of the building works themselves.\nFor these reasons, we conclude that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of the contract in finding that the completion date of the works was 20 October 2010. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider Ground 7.\nOrders\nFor the reasons given above, we make the following orders:\n\n1. The appeal is allowed in part.\n2. The orders made by the Tribunal on 16 March 2020 are set aside.\n3. The matter is remitted to the Tribunal for rehearing.\n4. The owners are to pay the builder’s costs of the appeal.",

In Ground 6, the issue is whether the Tribunal erred in finding that the completion date was 20 October 2010, while Ground 7 is about whether leave to appeal should be granted on the basis that the Tribunal's finding was against the weight of evidence.\n\nThe Tribunal found that practical completion of the building works took place on 20 October 2010 when the Final Occupation Certificate (FOC) was issued. The Tribunal relied on the definition of \"building works\" in the contract, which included \"completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations.\" The Tribunal also noted that the FOC was a planning and building approval that allowed lawful occupation of the building and that the contract required the final progress claim to be paid only on practical completion.\n\nIn relation to Ground 6, the Tribunal's conclusion about the completion date is a question of law, and leave to appeal is not required. As for Ground 7, the builder argues that the Tribunal's finding about the completion date was against the weight of evidence.
