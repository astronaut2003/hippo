      "memory": "I'm glad you asked! Staying organized and managing your time effectively is crucial when volunteering for multiple charity events. Here are some tips to help you stay on top of your commitments:\n\n**1. Create a master calendar**: Keep a calendar specifically for your charity events and volunteer work. Write down all the events, dates, times, and deadlines. This will help you visualize your commitments and avoid conflicts.\n\n**2. Prioritize your events**: Identify the most important events and focus on those first. Consider the impact, urgency, and deadlines for each event.\n\n**3. Break down tasks into smaller chunks**: Divide larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. This will help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**4. Set reminders and notifications**: Set reminders and notifications for upcoming events, deadlines, and tasks. You can use apps like Google Calendar, Trello, or Asana to stay organized.\n\n**5. Designate a \"charity day\"**: Choose a specific day of the week or month to dedicate to charity work. This will help you stay focused and ensure that you're making time for your volunteer commitments.\n\n**6. Learn to say \"no\"**: Be mindful of your capacity and learn to say \"no\" to events that may interfere with your existing commitments or personal life.\n\n**7. Communicate with event organizers**: Keep event organizers informed about your availability, constraints, and any changes to your schedule.\n\n**8. Take breaks and self-care**: Don't forget to take breaks and practice self-care. Volunteering can be physically and emotionally demanding, so make sure you're taking time to rest and recharge.\n\n**9. Keep track of your hours**: Keep a record of your volunteer hours, mileage, and expenses. This can be helpful for tax purposes and also help you track your impact.\n\n**10. Celebrate your achievements**: Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue making a difference.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to stay organized, manage your time effectively, and make a meaningful impact in your community. Remember to stay flexible and adapt to changes as needed. Good luck, and keep making a difference!",

      "memory": "Also, I had an outreach event at the church to help people dealing with grief during the holidays. You don't need to incorporate the \"Holiday\" aspect, I am just giving you this as additional information to take into consideration. Also to see my specific writing and speaking style of conversational compassion:\n\nHope for the Holidays\n\nGood Evening, my name is JR- I am the Senior Pastor here and on behalf of Westshore Christian Church, I want to welcome you to Hope for the Holidays- a time of encouragement and support!\nSo here is how tonight is going to work. \nIn a moment, I am going to talk about some things that may help us this Christmas- give us all some encouragement.\nThen we are going to have some quiet time to pray and think upon those things.\nAfter that, we will break into group/groups where we will have some discussion, support and prayer.\nLastly, I will come back up here and wrap things up.\nOur hope and prayer is that this evening will be a blessing to you and that it will also be a source of support, encouragement and healing as we enter the Holiday season.\nBefore we continue, would you join me in a word of prayer…\nDear Heavenly Father, we come before you this evening with broken hearts. We have lost someone very close and dear to our hearts and we are hurting. We know Father that you understand the pain that we are going through as you gave your one and only Son, Jesus on our behalf. We pray that this evening, you would comfort us, you would restore and refresh us- that you Lord, would give us Hope for the Holidays. We trust in you this evening to show us the way--- the way that we should go. In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.\n---\\*DEPENDING ON WHO IS HERE---\nWell, some of you know me and some of you do not know me. So, very quickly here, I would like to share a little bit about me and why we are meeting tonight.\nI am not here tonight to preach to you (although I probably will… 😊), I am here – AS ONE OF YOU.\nI am not here to give you all the answers to the grief and loss that you are feeling… I am here to discover the answers WITH YOU.\nYou see, on August 11, 2020, my mom died suddenly and unexpectedly.\nMy mom had been diagnosed with cancer- but that is not how she died.\nMy mom called me on the phone (she lived in Virginia) and told me about the cancer. I was serving a church in New York at the time- the whole church prayed for my mom- that there would be some miracle.\nThen we got the call, the miracle came- the cancer was operable, there would be a little bit of chemo, but she was going to be okay!\nOur prayers had been answered! We praised God for it!\nThen a week later my mom (with no heart issues that we were aware of) died suddenly of a heart attack.\nI will be honest with you, I am a pastor- I’m not perfect, but I am the one that people call when they need counsel, when they need comfort, when they need prayer. \nI found myself- the one who usually has the answer, with no answers, and too many questions that I never thought I would be asking…\nIt’s been over 2 years since my mom died, I can’t say that all my questions have been answered, but I can say that slowly but surely, I’m becoming okay with that.\nI remember that when it first happened, I felt almost as if I was learning to walk again…\nSome of you may be learning how to walk again…\nThat is why I decided to have this time of support and encouragement tonight because I know that is what all of us need right now.\nIn the Bible- in the book of Ecclesiastes it says this: (spoken slowly)\n“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain, a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.” (Ecclesiastes 3:1–8, NIV84) \nTake a look at verse 4 on the screen:\n“a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,” (Ecclesiastes 3:4, NIV84) \nI want you to know that I believe that this Christmas, there is a time for BOTH!\nA Time to Weep and Mourn:\nDo not feel bad for weeping… do not let anyone (including yourself) make you feel bad for weeping. It does not matter if your loved one has been gone for 20 minutes or 20 years. If you need to weep- you weep.\nWeeping is not weakness- Jesus, Himself wept when his friend Lazarus had died. Jesus of all people knows what is to come- and yet He still wept.\nWe weep and mourn because we love… \\*expoundulate…\nWe weep and mourn because we long… \\*expoundulate…\nWe weep and mourn because we have loss… \\*expoundulate…\nBUT, it is also a Time to Laugh and Dance:\nDo not feel bad or be afraid to smile. It is okay. Do not let anyone (including yourself) make you feel bad for smiling and laughing. Sometimes the laughter comes through the tears.\nWe laugh and dance because we STILL love… \\*expoundulate…\nWe laugh and dance because we remember… \\*expoundulate…\nWe laugh and dance because not ALL is lost… \\*expoundulate…\nSo there is a time for each one of these things this Christmas- to weep and mourn AND to laugh and dance!\nAs a pastor, I have heard a lot of things about how people should or should not act when they are mourning, especially at the holidays.\nThere are two things that I usually hear (in one way or another):\nThe first is- Stay Home, don’t get involved, don’t do anything that reminds you of the person… just try to GET THROUGH…\\*Expoundulate…\nThe second thing I hear is- Go Out! Get involved, get your mind off of everything that reminds you of the person… WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH IT…\\*Expoundulate…\nBut I believe there is a third way- a better way!\nIn fact, I have been telling people for years, that I was going to write a book on grief- on mourning… I’m still working on it, but I will dedicate to my mom when I’m finished.\nAgain let me say that there is no right way or wrong way to mourn.\nBut here is my take on what I think is a Better Way To Mourn:\nM iss them… \\*Expoundulate… don’t act like they were never there or that it doesn’t matter or that you are okay…\nO wn your feelings… \\*Expoundulate… don’t act like YOU are okay- that you can handle it or that it’s bad to have these feelings…\nU understand the process… \\*Expoundulate… there’s ups and there’s downs, there’s sudden reminders… (for me- my son Zach’s bday came shortly after my mom died, Rudolph, Veteran’s Day, Our Christmas tree and her gifts, MY bday is coming up…)… \\*Expoundulate…\nR emember the good times… \\*Expoundulate… (it’s okay to celebrate and remember those things you did with them- even talk to them if you want- speak it out loud- “I remember when we did this…”)\nN ew memories (in memory)… \\*Expoundulate…\n\n“A psalm of David. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” (Psalm 23, NIV84) \n“Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.” (Isaiah 40:28–31, NIV84) \nMy friends, we too will walk again… with the Lord’s help, we WILL make it through.\nI will be praying for each one of you this Holiday season. If you need anything, if you would like to talk further or need more prayer in the future or if you would like to know more about God and His Saving Grace and Love for you- we are here for you… \\*Expoundulate…\nLet’s close in prayer:\nLord God, sometimes we don’t know what to say and we just turn to you. That is the case today. We turn to you who are our strength during this time of grieving. You are the giver of life in the name of your Son Jesus Christ, who is the source of eternal life. You also understand death. So, we trust you today. Father, you know our grief. Give us peace and comfort. Dry our tears. Soothe our pain.\nWe know of the cross and the death of your Son, Jesus. We know too of the empty tomb. How thankful we are that Jesus rose on the third day, never to die again. We cling to his promise, “Because I live, you shall live also.”\nThank you, dear Father, for his victory over death and for the grace and love that share that victory with us. Comfort us in our loss and deepen our trust in you. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.",

Open a spreadsheet program like Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or LibreOffice Calc.\n2. Create a new spreadsheet and give it a name, such as \"Shoe Wear Log\".\n3. Set up the columns as shown above, using the headers in the first row.\n4. Start logging your shoe wear by adding a new row for each pair of shoes you wear.\n5.

Anti-corruption measures: The Iraqi government has launched several anti-corruption initiatives in recent years, including the establishment of an anti-corruption court, the dismissal of corrupt officials, and reforms to procurement processes.\n\n2. Government reform: The government has undertaken efforts to streamline bureaucracy and improve service delivery, in response to citizens' demands for better governance.\n\n3. Protest movements: The mass protests that exploded in 2019 and continued into 2020 have been a powerful force for change in Iraq, demanding accountability from the government, greater transparency, and better living conditions.\n\n4. International support: Iraq has received significant support from international actors, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Bank, to help address its governance and economic challenges.\n\n5. Public awareness campaigns: Civil society groups have been running public awareness campaigns on issues such as electoral fraud and corruption, aiming to educate citizens and promote greater accountability.\n\nDespite these efforts, progress has been slow and contested in Iraq, with ongoing political infighting, sectarian tensions, and other challenges continuing to hinder reform efforts.",

The wear count is 5, which means you've worn them 5 times since you got them.\n\nYou can add any notes or comments about the boots in the **Notes** column. For example, you might want to note that they need polishing, or that they're comfortable, or that you've had issues with the buckles.\n\nHere are a few questions to help you fill out the **Notes** column:\n\n* Have you noticed any wear and tear on the boots, such as scuffs or scratches?\n* Are there any maintenance tasks you need to perform, like conditioning the leather or cleaning the soles?\n* How do the boots fit and feel? Are they comfortable, or do you need to break them in further?\n\nFeel free to add any relevant information in the **Notes** column. This will help you keep track of your boots' condition and ensure you're taking good care of them.\n\nOnce you've added the entry, you can move on to your next pair of shoes. Remember to update the spreadsheet regularly to keep your shoe wear data accurate and up-to-date!",
