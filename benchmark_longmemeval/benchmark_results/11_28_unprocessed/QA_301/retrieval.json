Using VR headsets, visitors will be able to explore the ancient landscape, getting up close and personal with these magnificent creatures in a way that would have been impossible in real life.\n\nThe AR component will be integrated into the exhibit through a mobile app, which visitors can download before or during their visit. Using the app, visitors will be able to point their devices at specific fossils or exhibits and unlock additional content, such as 3D models, videos, and interactive simulations. For example, visitors might use the app to:\n\n1. **See a 3D model of an Edmontosaurus skeleton**: By pointing their device at a fossil display, visitors can see a 3D model of the skeleton, complete with interactive labels and information about the different bones.\n2. **Watch a hadrosaur feeding simulation**: Visitors can use the app to trigger a simulation of a hadrosaur feeding on plants, complete with animations and sound effects.\n3. **Explore a hadrosaur nest**: The app might allow visitors to explore a virtual hadrosaur nest, complete with eggs, nests, and other fossilized remains.\n\nThe museum is also planning to incorporate some innovative uses of projection mapping and interactive screens throughout the exhibit, which will help to create an immersive and engaging experience for visitors.\n\nOverall, the museum is really pushing the boundaries of what's possible in a natural history exhibit, and I think visitors are going to be blown away by the combination of cutting-edge technology and fascinating fossil specimens.",

As it happens, the museum is currently planning an exciting new exhibit on hadrosaurs, with a special focus on the Edmontosaurus. The exhibit is titled \"Hadrosaurs: The Duck-Billed Giants of the Cretaceous\" and is scheduled to open in about six months.\n\nThe exhibit will feature an impressive collection of hadrosaur fossils, including several Edmontosaurus specimens, as well as interactive displays, videos, and immersive experiences. Some of the highlights include:\n\n1. **A nearly complete Edmontosaurus skeleton**: The museum has recently acquired a stunning Edmontosaurus fossil, which will be the centerpiece of the exhibit. The skeleton is remarkably well-preserved, with many of its bones still articulated in their original position.\n2. **Hadrosaur skin impressions**: The exhibit will feature several hadrosaur skin impressions, which will give visitors a unique glimpse into the texture and pattern of these dinosaurs' skin.\n3. **Interactive beak simulation**: Visitors will be able to try out a simulated hadrosaur beak, learning how these remarkable creatures used their distinctive bills to gather and process food.\n4. **Life-sized hadrosaur models**: The exhibit will feature life-sized models of several hadrosaur species, including the Edmontosaurus, allowing visitors to get up close and personal with these incredible creatures.\n5. **Fossil preparation lab**: The museum will also be setting up a fossil preparation lab as part of the exhibit, where visitors can watch paleontologists and preparators at work, cleaning and conserving hadrosaur fossils.\n\nThe museum is also planning a range of accompanying programs and events, including lectures, workshops, and family activities. If you're interested in staying up-to-date on the exhibit's progress and receiving notifications about upcoming events, I recommend checking the museum's website or social media channels for more information.\n\nI hope you're as excited as I am about this upcoming exhibit!",
