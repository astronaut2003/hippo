      "memory": "A new mesh network system, that's great! It's not uncommon for a faster internet connection to expose bottlenecks in other areas of your setup, and an old computer can definitely be a limiting factor.\n\nRandom freezing can be frustrating and annoying. Upgrading your desktop computer can be a great way to breathe new life into your setup and take full advantage of your improved internet connection. Here are some potential upgrades to consider:\n\n1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** If your current CPU is several years old, it might be struggling to keep up with modern demands. A newer, faster CPU can help with overall system responsiveness and reduce freezing.\n2. **RAM (Memory):** Adding more RAM or replacing existing RAM with faster, higher-capacity modules can help your computer handle multiple tasks simultaneously and reduce freezing.\n3. **Storage:** If you're still using a traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD), consider upgrading to a Solid-State Drive (SSD). SSDs are much faster, more reliable, and can greatly improve system responsiveness.\n4. **Graphics Card:** If you're a gamer or use graphics-intensive programs, a newer, more powerful graphics card can help reduce freezing and improve performance.\n5. **Motherboard and BIOS:** If your motherboard is old, it might not support newer hardware or features. Upgrading to a newer motherboard with a modern BIOS can provide better compatibility and performance.\n6. **Operating System:** If you're running an older operating system, it might be time to consider upgrading to a newer version, such as Windows 10 or a Linux distribution.\n7. **Cooling System:** If your computer is overheating, it can cause freezing. Consider upgrading your cooling system, such as adding more fans or a liquid cooling system.\n\nBefore you start upgrading, it's a good idea to:\n\n* Run a virus scan and malware removal tools to ensure your system is clean.\n* Check your system's event logs to see if there are any error messages or patterns that might indicate the cause of the freezing.\n* Consider running a system benchmarking tool, like Geekbench or Cinebench, to get an idea of your computer's current performance.\n\nBy identifying the root cause of the freezing issue and targeting the right upgrades, you can breathe new life into your desktop computer and enjoy a smoother, faster experience with your new mesh network system.\n\nWhat's your current desktop computer's specs, and what's your budget for upgrades?",

      "memory": "Let's take a closer look at your router's settings to see if we can identify the issue.\n\nTo access your router's settings, you'll need to log in to its web interface. The process is usually similar across most routers, but the exact steps might vary depending on the model and manufacturer. Here's a general guide to get you started:\n\n1. **Open a web browser**: Use a device that's currently connected to your router via Ethernet or Wi-Fi (it's best to use a wired connection if possible).\n2. **Type the router's IP address**: In the address bar, type the router's IP address. The most common IP addresses are:\n\t* 192.168.0.1\n\t* 192.168.1.1\n\t* 10.0.0.1\n\t* 10.1.10.1\n\nIf you're not sure what your router's IP address is, you can:\n\n\t* Check the router's documentation or packaging\n\t* Look for a sticker on the router itself\n\t* Search online for your router model and \"default IP address\"\n3. **Log in to the router**: Enter the router's login credentials. The default username and password are usually:\n\t* Username: admin\n\t* Password: password (or leave it blank)\n\nNote: If you've changed the login credentials, use the ones you set. If you're unsure, try resetting the router to its default settings (be cautious, as this will erase all custom settings).\n\n4. **Access the Wireless settings**: Once logged in, navigate to the Wireless or Wi-Fi settings. This might be under Advanced Settings, Wireless Settings, or a similar section.\n5. **Check the Wi-Fi network settings**: Look for the following information:\n\t* Wi-Fi Network Name (SSID): Ensure it's set to broadcast the correct network name.\n\t* Wi-Fi Channel: Check which channel is currently in use. You can try changing it to a different channel to see if it improves the connection.\n\t* Wi-Fi Frequency: Check if the router is set to use 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or both. You might need to switch between frequencies to see if it resolves the issue.\n\t* Bandwidth: Ensure it's set to 20/40 MHz or Auto, depending on your router's capabilities.\n6. **Check for firmware updates**: Look for a section labeled Firmware Update or Software Update. If an update is available, follow the instructions to download and install it.\n\nSome popular router models have slightly different interfaces, so don't worry if the exact steps vary. You can usually find online resources or user manuals specific to your router model for more detailed instructions.\n\nOnce you've accessed your router's settings, take note of the Wi-Fi frequency band and channel in use. We can discuss further adjustments or troubleshooting steps based on what you find.\n\nRemember to be cautious when making changes to your router's settings, as it might affect your internet connection or other devices on your network. If you're unsure about any settings, feel free to ask, and I'll guide you through the process.",

However, passengers are generally able to connect to free Wi-Fi at many stations along the Northern Line, and TfL has announced plans to roll out Wi-Fi connectivity on board its trains starting in 2020. So while the current Northern Line trains may not have these amenities, it's possible that future upgrades or installations may include features like Wi-Fi to improve the passenger experience.",
