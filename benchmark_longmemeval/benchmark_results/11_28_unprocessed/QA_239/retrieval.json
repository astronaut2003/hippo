Here are some effective ways to reach out to your classmates and get them to commit to attending:\n\n1. **Social Media**:\n\t* Create a private Facebook group or event page dedicated to the reunion. Invite classmates to join and share updates, memories, and photos.\n\t* Use Instagram, Twitter, and other platforms to spread the word and create a buzz around the event.\n\t* Share behind-the-scenes peeks at the planning process, sneak peeks of the venue, or throwback photos to generate excitement.\n2. **Personalized Emails**:\n\t* Send personalized emails to classmates, addressing them by name and referencing shared memories or inside jokes.\n\t* Share a personal message explaining why you're excited about the reunion and why you think they should attend.\n\t* Include a clear call-to-action, such as RSVPing or buying tickets.\n3. **Phone Calls and Texts**:\n\t* Reach out to close friends or classmates you've kept in touch with over the years.\n\t* Make personal phone calls or send texts to encourage them to attend and offer to help with logistics (e.g., transportation or accommodations).\n4. **Classmate Ambassadors**:\n\t* Identify enthusiastic classmates who can help spread the word and encourage their friends to attend.\n\t* Ask them to share the reunion information with their networks and provide updates on the planning process.\n5. **Class Newsletter or Update**:\n\t* Create a newsletter or update that summarizes the reunion details, including the date, time, location, and agenda.\n\t* Share news about classmates, such as new jobs, marriages, or children, to create a sense of community and nostalgia.\n6. **Classmate Testimonials**:\n\t* Reach out to classmates who have already committed to attending and ask them to share their reasons for coming.\n\t* Use their testimonials in promotional materials, such as social media posts or emails, to build excitement and credibility.\n7. **Early Bird Incentives**:\n\t* Offer discounts or incentives for early RSVPs or ticket purchases to encourage classmates to commit early.\n\t* Create a sense of urgency by offering limited-time promotions or exclusive deals for early birds.\n8. **Reunion Website**:\n\t* Create a dedicated website for the reunion, including essential details, photos, and updates.\n\t* Encourage classmates to visit the website and RSVP online.\n9. **Reunion Video**:\n\t* Create a video showcasing memories from your high school days, set to music or with a narrative.\n\t* Share the video on social media, email, or the reunion website to evoke nostalgia and excitement.\n10. **Follow-up and Reminders**:\n\t* Send regular reminders and updates to keep the reunion top of mind for classmates.\n\t* Follow up with classmates who have expressed interest but haven't yet RSVP'd or purchased tickets.\n\nRemember to stay organized, keep track of responses, and update your classmates regularly. By using a combination of these methods, you'll be more likely to get your classmates excited and committed to attending the reunion.",

You can also search for hashtags related to e-commerce and Los Angeles.\n4. **Event calendars**: Check event calendars like Lanyrd, Eventbrite, or 10times to see if they have any e-commerce events listed in Los Angeles for next month.\n\nIf you're still unable to find the specific event you're looking for, you can try reaching out to colleagues or industry connections to see if they have any information about upcoming e-commerce events in LA.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you track down the event you're interested in!",
