To sort your loyalty program data:\n\n1. Select the entire table by clicking on the top-left corner of the table or pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac).\n2. Go to the \"Data\" menu and click on \"Sort & Filter\" (in Google Sheets) or \"Sort\" (in Microsoft Excel).\n3. Choose the column you want to sort by (e.g., \"Expiration Date\").\n4. Select the sorting order (e.g., \"Ascending\" or \"Descending\").\n5. Click \"Sort\" to apply the sorting.\n\nFor example, if you sort the \"Expiration Date\" column in ascending order, the programs with the nearest expiration dates will appear at the top of the list.\n\n**Filtering:**\n\nFiltering allows you to narrow down your data to show only specific information. To filter your loyalty program data:\n\n1. Select the entire table by clicking on the top-left corner of the table or pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac).\n2. Go to the \"Data\" menu and click on \"Sort & Filter\" (in Google Sheets) or \"Filter\" (in Microsoft Excel).\n3. Click on the filter icon (a small triangle) in the header row of the column you want to filter (e.g., \"Expiration Date\").\n4. Select \"Filter by condition\" and choose the condition you want to apply (e.g., \"Is before\" or \"Is within the next\").\n5. Enter the specific date or date range you want to filter by (e.g., \"April 15th\" or \"Within the next 30 days\").\n6. Click \"OK\" to apply the filter.\n\nFor example, if you filter the \"Expiration Date\" column to show only programs expiring within the next 30 days, you'll see a list of programs that require your attention soon.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use the \"Filter\" function to quickly see which programs have rewards expiring soon or to focus on a specific type of reward (e.g., points, miles, or cash back).\n* Use the \"Sort\" function to prioritize your programs based on factors like expiration date, reward type, or balance.\n* You can also use conditional formatting to highlight cells that meet certain conditions, such as rewards expiring soon or balances below a certain threshold.\n\nNow that you know the basics of sorting and filtering, you can easily manage your loyalty programs and stay on top of your rewards.\n\nDo you have any questions about sorting and filtering, or would you like to learn more about conditional formatting or other spreadsheet features?",

Here are some valuable tips to help you minimize the risk of injury and optimize your performance during the charity tournament:\n\n**Injury Prevention Strategies:**\n\n1. **Warm up and cool down properly**: Before playing, warm up with light cardio (jogging, jumping jacks) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, high knees, hip circles). After the game, cool down with static stretches (hamstrings, quadriceps, calves).\n2. **Hydrate and fuel**: Drink plenty of water or sports drinks to stay hydrated. Fuel your body with a balanced meal or snack 1-2 hours before playing, including complex carbs, protein, and healthy fats.\n3. **Listen to your body**: If you're feeling tired or experiencing pain, take regular breaks to rest and recover. Don't push yourself too hard, especially if you're not used to playing soccer regularly.\n4. **Use proper technique**: Focus on proper tackling, landing, and ball control techniques to reduce the risk of injuries.\n5. **Wear protective gear**: Wear shin guards, and consider wearing knee-high socks and elbow pads for added protection.\n6. **Stay flexible and strong**: Regularly incorporate exercises that improve your flexibility, strength, and core stability, such as squats, lunges, and planks.\n\n**Recovery Strategies:**\n\n1. **Stretch and foam roll**: After the game, take 10-15 minutes to stretch your major muscle groups, including your legs, hips, and lower back. Use a foam roller to release tension in your IT band, quadriceps, and hamstrings.\n2. **Ice and compression**: If you experience any pain or swelling, apply ice to the affected area for 10-15 minutes, followed by compression bandages or sleeves to reduce inflammation.\n3. **Replenish fluids and electrolytes**: Drink sports drinks or coconut water to replenish lost electrolytes and fluids.\n4. **Rest and recovery**: Allow your body time to recover between games, if you're playing multiple matches. Aim for at least 30-60 minutes of rest and recovery time.\n5. **Post-game nutrition**: Refuel with a balanced meal or snack that includes protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats within 30-60 minutes after the game.\n6. **Active recovery**: Engage in low-intensity activities like walking, cycling, or swimming to promote blood flow and aid in recovery.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Get enough sleep (7-9 hours) before the tournament to ensure you're well-rested and ready to perform.\n* Avoid playing if you're experiencing any underlying medical conditions, such as a concussion or muscle strain.\n* Communicate with your teammates and opponents about any injuries or concerns during the game.\n\nBy following these injury prevention and recovery strategies, you'll be well-prepared to enjoy the charity tournament while minimizing the risk of injury. Have fun, stay safe, and good luck!",
