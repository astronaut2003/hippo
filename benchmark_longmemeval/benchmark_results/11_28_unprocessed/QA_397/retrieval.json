It's a popular choice for BBQ and pairs well with pulled pork.\n2. **Franklin Barbecue BBQ Sauce**: A Texas-style BBQ sauce with a thinner, more vinegar-based consistency. It's great for those who prefer a tangier BBQ sauce.\n3. **Bone Suckin' BBQ Sauce**: A sweet and smoky sauce with a thick, syrupy texture. It's made with a blend of spices and has a nice balance of sweet and tangy flavors.\n4. **Stubb's BBQ Sauce**: A Texas-style BBQ sauce with a thick, sweet, and smoky flavor profile. It's great for those who prefer a sweeter BBQ sauce.\n5. **Dinosaur Bar-B-Que BBQ Sauce**: A sweet and tangy sauce with a thick, syrupy texture. It's made with a blend of spices and has a nice balance of sweet and tangy flavors.\n\n**Tips for Choosing a BBQ Sauce:**\n\n1. **Consider the flavor profile**: Think about the flavor profile you want to achieve with your BBQ sauce.

For pulled pork, a sweet and tangy sauce is often a good choice.\n3. **Experiment with different brands**: Try out different brands and flavor profiles to find the one that you enjoy the most.\n4. **Make your own BBQ sauce**: If you're feeling adventurous, try making your own BBQ sauce from scratch. This will allow you to customize the flavor to your liking.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Use it as a finishing sauce**: Apply the BBQ sauce to the pulled pork during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking to give it a nice glaze.\n* **Offer options**: Consider offering multiple BBQ sauce options for your guests to choose from. This will allow them to customize their pulled pork sandwiches to their taste.\n\nI hope these recommendations and tips help you find the perfect BBQ sauce to serve with your pulled pork!",
