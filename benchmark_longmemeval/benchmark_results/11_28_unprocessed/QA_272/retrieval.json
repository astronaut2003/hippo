What is the location of the wildlife refuge you're planning to visit? (State or region)\n2. What time of year is it currently (spring, summer, fall, winter)?\n3. Are there any specific habitats or areas within the refuge you plan to focus on (e.g. wetlands, forests, grasslands)?\n\nWith this information, I can give you a better idea of what birds you might expect to see during your visit.",

Since you saw them on your guided bird walk a month and a half ago, it's likely that the Yellow Warblers you saw have already moved on to their breeding grounds.\n\nHowever, it's not impossible that some stragglers might still be lingering in the area. Yellow Warblers can be found in the southeast during the spring migration, and some individuals might take a bit longer to make their way north. Additionally, some Yellow Warblers might be breeding in the southeast, particularly in areas with suitable habitat.\n\nThat being said, you might want to focus on other warbler species that are more likely to be present during this time. Some warblers that are known to migrate through the southeast during the spring, around this time of year, include:\n\n* American Goldfinch\n* Black-and-white Warbler\n* Prothonotary Warbler\n* Northern Parula\n* Yellow-throated Warbler\n* Hooded Warbler\n\nKeep in mind that the exact timing of warbler migration can vary depending on weather conditions, food availability, and other factors. It's always a good idea to check with local birding reports and birding groups for up-to-date information on recent sightings in your area.\n\nGood luck on your birding trip, and I hope you spot some of the warbler species you're looking for!",

      "memory": "The wetlands area is an excellent spot to look for warblers during migration, and Merlin can definitely help you identify any warblers you might spot.\n\nMerlin's database includes a vast range of bird species, including warblers, and it's particularly strong on species that can be found in wetlands. When you're in the wetlands, you can use Merlin's \"Bird ID\" feature to help you identify any warblers you see.\n\nHere's how you can use Merlin to identify warblers in the wetlands:\n\n1. Open the Merlin app and select \"Bird ID\" from the main menu.\n2. Choose \"Wetlands\" as your habitat, and select the date and time of your visit.\n3. Merlin will ask you to input some details about the bird you're trying to identify, such as its size, plumage color, and any distinctive features you've observed.\n4. Based on your input, Merlin will provide you with a list of possible species, along with photos and descriptions to help you make a positive ID.\n5. If you're still unsure, you can use Merlin's \"Compare\" feature to view side-by-side comparisons of different species, which can be really helpful for distinguishing between similar-looking warblers.\n\nSome warblers you might spot in the wetlands during migration include:\n\n* Yellow Warbler\n* American Goldfinch\n* Common Yellowthroat\n* Northern Parula\n* Prothonotary Warbler\n\nKeep in mind that warblers can be tricky to identify, especially when they're in their non-breeding plumage. But with Merlin's help, you'll have a much better chance of making a positive ID.\n\nRemember to also pay attention to the bird's behavior, habitat, and any other distinctive features, as these can be important clues for identification. And don't hesitate to take photos or make notes to help you remember the details of your observation.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you spot some exciting warblers in the wetlands!",

You can listen to recordings of individual species, compare different calls and songs, and even record and upload your own observations to help improve the database.\n\nOne of the most useful features for learning bird songs is Merlin's \"Sound ID\" tool. You can record a bird call or song using your phone's microphone, and Merlin's AI algorithm will try to match it to a species in its database. This can be super helpful when you're out in the field and hear a bird calling, but can't quite place the sound.\n\nMerlin's Sound ID feature uses machine learning to improve over time, so the more people use it, the better it gets. You can even submit your recordings to help improve the algorithm and contribute to the birding community!\n\nAdditionally, Merlin provides a \"Sound Explorer\" feature, which allows you to browse through a species' different vocalizations, such as songs, calls, and alarm calls. This can help you learn the various sounds a species makes and improve your skills in identifying birds by ear.\n\nImproving your skills in identifying birds by their songs is a great goal, and Merlin is an excellent tool to help you achieve it. With practice and patience, you'll become more confident in your ability to recognize bird calls and songs, and it will open up a whole new dimension of birding excitement!\n\nKeep in mind that Merlin is a powerful tool, but it's not a replacement for learning and practice. The more you use it, the more you'll learn, and the better you'll become at identifying birds by their songs. Happy birding!",
