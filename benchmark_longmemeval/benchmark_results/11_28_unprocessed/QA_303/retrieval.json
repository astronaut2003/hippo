Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Fruit and vegetables**: Set up a colorful arrangement of seasonal fruits or vegetables, like apples, oranges, grapes, or a bowl of tomatoes.\n2. **Vintage items**: Gather a collection of vintage items like old cameras, clocks, books, or antique trinkets to create a nostalgic and interesting composition.\n3. **Kitchenware**: Focus on a single item, like a beautiful ceramic vase, a tea set, or a copper pot, or create a still life with a mix of kitchen items, like a wooden spoon, a mortar and pestle, and a few spices.\n4. **Bottles and jars**: Set up a grouping of glass bottles, jars, or vases in different shapes and sizes, filled with flowers, branches, or simply left empty.\n5. **Musical instruments**: If you or someone in your household plays an instrument, consider painting a still life with a guitar, violin, or other instrument as the main subject.\n6. **Floral arrangements**: While you've already done sunflowers, you could explore other flower arrangements, like a bouquet of wildflowers, a single peony, or a branch of cherry blossoms.\n7. **Tea time**: Create a cozy still life with a teapot, cups, saucers, and a few sweet treats like cookies or macarons.\n8. **Books and papers**: Set up a still life with a stack of books, a few papers, and a reading lamp to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n9. **Personal treasures**: Gather a collection of personal items that hold sentimental value, like family heirlooms, jewelry, or mementos, to create a meaningful and introspective still life.\n10. **Everyday objects**: Take a closer look at everyday items like a pair of scissors, a sewing machine, or a collection of keys, and find the beauty in their shapes, textures, and forms.\n\nRemember, the key to a great still life painting is to find an arrangement that resonates with you and sparks your creativity. Experiment with different compositions, lighting setups, and color palettes to make your artwork unique and engaging.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create another beautiful still life painting!",

Given your constraints, here are some suggestions for meal prep on your days off to help you eat healthy and save time during the week:\n\n**Lunch Prep for the Office:**\n\n1. **Soup or Stew**: Cook a large batch of soup or stew on your day off, portion it out into individual containers, and refrigerate or freeze for up to 3-4 days. This way, you can grab a container and go on weekdays.\n2. **Salad Jars**: Prepare a week's worth of salad jars by layering greens, veggies, and proteins (e.g., chicken, tuna, or tofu) in a jar. Add a simple vinaigrette, and you're good to go!\n3. **Rice or Quinoa Bowls**: Cook a large batch of rice or quinoa and top it with different ingredients like grilled chicken, roasted veggies, and avocado. Portion out individual bowls and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n4. **Mason Jar Meals**: Prepare individual portions of meals like chicken or veggie wraps, pasta salads, or overnight oats in mason jars. These are easy to grab and go.\n\n**Quick and Easy Meals for Weeknights:**\n\n1. **Slow Cooker Meals**: Use a slow cooker to prepare meals like chili, chicken tacos, or lentil curry on your day off. These can be refrigerated or frozen for up to 3-4 days and reheated quickly on weeknights.\n2. **Grilled Chicken or Veggies**: Grill a large batch of chicken breasts or prep a variety of roasted veggies (e.g., broccoli, sweet potatoes, and Brussels sprouts) on your day off. Use these as a base for quick meals during the week.\n3. **Overnight Oats**: Prepare individual portions of overnight oats in jars or containers on your day off. These can be refrigerated for up to 3 days and are a quick, healthy breakfast option.\n4. **Freezer Meals**: Cook and freeze individual portions of meals like meatballs, burgers, or veggie patties on your day off. Simply thaw and reheat on weeknights.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Label and Date Containers**: Label and date your meal prep containers so you know what you have and how long it's been in the fridge or freezer.\n* **Mix and Match**: Mix and match different ingredients to create new meals throughout the week. For example, use last week's chicken in a new salad or add different toppings to your rice bowls.\n* **Shop Smart**: Plan your meals around what's on sale or in season to save time and money.\n* **Involve a Friend**: Consider meal prepping with a friend or family member to split costs, share recipes, and make the process more enjoyable.\n\nBy implementing these meal prep strategies, you'll save time during the week, eat healthier, and reduce the likelihood of relying on quick, unhealthy options.\n\nDo you have any specific dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free) that might influence your meal prep choices?",
