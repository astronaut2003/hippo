I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or physically attend classes. I'm here to provide information and answer your questions to the best of my abilities!\n\nHowever, I can provide you with some general information about cooking classes that might be helpful. Cooking classes can vary in length and format, depending on the type of class, the instructor, and the culinary school or institution offering the class.\n\nSome cooking classes might be:\n\n* One-day workshops: These classes typically last a few hours and focus on a specific technique or dish.\n* Series of classes: These classes might meet once a week for several weeks, covering a range of topics or cuisines.\n* Online classes: With the rise of online learning, many cooking classes are now offered online, which can be convenient for those with busy schedules.\n\nIf you're interested in taking a cooking class to learn how to make homemade pasta from scratch, I recommend searching for local culinary schools, cooking studios, or online platforms that offer classes in your area. You can also check with local Italian restaurants or specialty food stores to see if they offer cooking classes or workshops.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
