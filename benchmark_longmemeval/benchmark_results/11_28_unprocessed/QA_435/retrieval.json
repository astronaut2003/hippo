      "memory": "What a great idea! Air Fryer sweet potato fries are a fantastic side dish that pairs well with many of the meals I mentioned earlier. Here are some tips to help you achieve crispy and delicious sweet potato fries in your Air Fryer:\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. **Choose the right sweet potatoes**: Look for sweet potatoes that are high in starch, like Russet or Idaho potatoes, as they will yield a crisper exterior.\n2. **Cut the sweet potatoes correctly**: Cut the sweet potatoes into long, thin strips, about 1/2 inch thick (1 cm). Try to make the cuts as uniform as possible so that they cook evenly.\n3. **Soak the sweet potato strips**: To remove excess starch and help the fries become crisper, soak the cut sweet potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes. After soaking, pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.\n\n**Air Fryer Settings:**\n\n1. **Temperature**: Set the Air Fryer to 400°F (200°C).\n2. **Cooking time**: Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your sweet potato strips and your desired level of crispiness. As a general guideline, cook for 12-15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.\n3. **Shake the basket**: Halfway through the cooking time, shake the basket to redistribute the fries and ensure even cooking.\n\n**Tips for Crispy Fries:**\n\n1. **Don't overcrowd the basket**: Cook the sweet potato fries in batches if necessary, to ensure they have enough room to cook evenly. Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of crisping.\n2. **Use a small amount of oil**: You can lightly spray the sweet potato fries with oil (e.g., avocado oil or cooking spray) before cooking, but be cautious not to over-oil, as this can prevent crisping.\n3. **Don't open the Air Fryer too often**: Resist the temptation to check on the fries too frequently, as this can release heat and affect the crisping process.\n4. **Season after cooking**: Season the sweet potato fries with salt and any other desired seasonings after cooking, as the heat can cause seasonings to burn or lose flavor.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Experiment with seasonings**: Try different seasoning combinations, such as paprika, garlic powder, or chili powder, to add flavor to your sweet potato fries.\n2. **Keep an eye on the fries**: Monitor the fries during the cooking process, and adjust the cooking time or temperature as needed to achieve your desired level of crispiness.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve deliciously crispy sweet potato fries in your Air Fryer. Enjoy them with your bean- or lentil-based meals!",

There are many delicious options, but here are some popular ones you might enjoy:\n\n1. **Soy sauce-based sauce**: A classic choice, made with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, and sometimes cornstarch to thicken. You can add garlic, ginger, and chili flakes for extra flavor.\n2. **Oyster sauce-based sauce**: Similar to the soy sauce-based sauce, but with oyster sauce added for a richer, savory flavor.\n3. **Sesame oil and soy sauce**: A simple yet flavorful combination, with sesame oil adding a nutty aroma and soy sauce providing depth.\n4. **Honey and hoisin sauce**: Sweet and savory, this sauce is great for those who prefer a milder flavor. You can add some rice vinegar and soy sauce for balance.\n5. **Kung Pao sauce**: Spicy and savory, made with soy sauce, vinegar, hoisin sauce, and hot peppers. Perfect for those who like a little heat!\n6. **Peanut sauce**: Creamy and nutty, made with peanut butter, soy sauce, and spices. Great for a Thai-inspired stir-fry.\n\nYou can also experiment with different combinations of these ingredients to create your own signature stir-fry sauce.\n\nIf you're short on time, you can even use store-bought stir-fry sauces, which are widely available in most supermarkets.\n\nBy the way, $60 seems like a reasonable amount for a grocery haul, considering the convenience of Instacart and the variety of ingredients you can get. Did you get everything you needed for your stir-fry?\n\nWhat type of protein and vegetables are you planning to use in your stir-fry? I'd be happy to provide more specific suggestions!",
