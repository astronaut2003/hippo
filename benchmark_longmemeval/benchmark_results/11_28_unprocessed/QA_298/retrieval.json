Here are some other ideas for using up leftover vegetables:\n\n1. **Veggie soup**: Similar to your beef stew, you can make a big pot of vegetable soup with a variety of leftover vegetables, such as carrots, celery, potatoes, and onions.\n2. **Stir-fry**: Stir-fries are a great way to use up a mix of leftover vegetables, such as bell peppers, broccoli, and mushrooms. Serve with rice, noodles, or as a standalone dish.\n3. **Roasted vegetable quinoa bowl**: Roast a variety of leftover vegetables like Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, and cauliflower, and serve over quinoa with a dollop of tzatziki sauce or a fried egg.\n4. **Veggie omelette**: Whip up an omelette with eggs and fill it with leftover vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms.\n5. **Frittata**: Similar to an omelette, but in a larger, Italian-style egg dish. Add leftover vegetables like zucchini, tomatoes, and spinach.\n6. **Veggie burgers**: Use leftover vegetables like carrots, zucchini, and mushrooms to make a veggie burger patty. Serve on a bun with your favorite toppings.\n7. **Grilled vegetable wrap**: Fill a wrap with leftover grilled vegetables like eggplant, zucchini, and red onion, and top with hummus or tzatziki sauce.\n8. **Veggie fritters**: Shred or chop leftover vegetables like carrots, zucchini, and cabbage, and mix with flour, eggs, and spices. Form into patties and fry until crispy.\n9. **Leftover veggie hash**: Dice leftover vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and onions, and pan-fry until crispy. Serve as a side dish or add to breakfast dishes like eggs and toast.\n10. **Freeze them**: If you can't use up all your leftover vegetables before they go bad, consider freezing them for future meals. Many vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots freeze well and can be added to soups, stews, or stir-fries later.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create some delicious meals with your leftover vegetables!",
