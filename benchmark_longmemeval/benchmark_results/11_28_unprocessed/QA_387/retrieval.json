In a small bowl, mix together the chia seeds, cocoa powder, and salt.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the plant-based milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract (if using).\n3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until the chia seeds are well coated.\n4. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight (4-6 hours).\n5. After the chia pudding has chilled, give it a good stir to redistribute the chia seeds. You can also add any toppings you like, such as:\n\t* Fresh fruit (berries, sliced bananas, or diced mango)\n\t* Shredded coconut\n\t* Chocolate shavings or chocolate chips\n\t* Whipped coconut cream\n\t* Nuts or seeds (hazelnuts, almonds, or chia seeds)\n6.

I hope you enjoy your delicious and healthy Chocolate Chia Pudding. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any variations on this recipe.",

      "memory": "That sounds like a delicious side dish! I can help you with a recipe that combines the flavors of baked beans and coleslaw. Here's a recipe that might come close to what you had at Smokey's BBQ joint:\n\n**Smokey's-Style Baked Bean and Coleslaw Mix**\n\n**Baked Bean Component:**\n\n* 1 (15 oz) can of pork and beans, drained and rinsed\n* 1/4 cup of ketchup\n* 2 tablespoons of brown sugar\n* 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar\n* 1 teaspoon of ground mustard\n* 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley\n\n**Coleslaw Component:**\n\n* 2 cups of shredded cabbage\n* 1 cup of shredded carrots\n* 1/4 cup of mayonnaise\n* 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard\n* 1/2 teaspoon of sugar\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley\n\n**Assembly:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 275°F (135°C).\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pork and beans, ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, ground mustard, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well until the beans are coated.\n3. Transfer the bean mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish and bake for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n4. While the beans are baking, prepare the coleslaw. In a separate bowl, combine the shredded cabbage, carrots, mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well until the slaw is creamy and tangy.\n5. Once the beans are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly.\n6. Add the coleslaw mixture on top of the baked beans and stir until well combined.\n7. Sprinkle the chopped parsley on top and serve warm or at room temperature.\n\nTips to get closer to Smokey's flavor:\n\n* **Use a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce:** Instead of using ketchup, try using a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce like the one I provided earlier. This will give the baked beans a richer flavor profile.\n* **Add some smokiness:** Add a pinch of smoked paprika or chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to the baked beans for an extra smoky flavor.\n* **Use a variety of cabbages:** Experiment with different types of cabbages, such as red cabbage or napa cabbage, to give the coleslaw a more complex flavor profile.\n* **Add some crunch:** Add some chopped onions, bell peppers, or jalapeños to the coleslaw for an extra crunch and flavor boost.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point, and you can adjust the recipe to your taste. Don't be afraid to experiment and add your own twist to make it even more delicious!",

The sweetness of the peaches, nectarines, and plums will pair nicely with the savory flavors of the soup, and the freshness of the berries will add a nice burst of flavor and color. The fresh mint garnish will add a bright and refreshing touch to the dish.\n\nArranging the fruit in a pattern on a large platter will make for a beautiful and visually appealing presentation. You can create a pattern with the sliced fruit, or simply arrange them in a way that looks pleasing to the eye. Don't forget to leave a little space between the fruit to create a clean and uncluttered look.\n\nHere are a few more tips to make your Summer Mix fruit platter stand out:\n\n* Make sure to wash and dry the fruit thoroughly before arranging them on the platter.\n* Consider using a variety of colors and textures to add visual interest to the platter. For example, you could use yellow peaches, white nectarines, and purple plums.\n* Don't overcrowd the platter. Leave a little space between the fruit to create a clean and uncluttered look.\n* Consider adding a few fresh flowers or leaves to the platter to add a pop of color and fragrance.\n* If you want to add a little extra flavor to the fruit, you could sprinkle a bit of sugar or honey over the top of the platter.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful! Your Summer Mix fruit platter is sure to be a hit with your guests. Enjoy!",
