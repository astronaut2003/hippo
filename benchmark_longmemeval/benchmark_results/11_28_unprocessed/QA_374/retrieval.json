The bitterness of the grapefruit pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the tequila, and the lime juice adds a nice touch of acidity.\n\nThe Tequila Sour is indeed a unique twist on the classic margarita, and the addition of egg white gives it a silky, velvety texture. The orange liqueur adds a subtle citrus flavor that complements the tequila nicely. It's a great cocktail to try if you want to experiment with egg whites in cocktails.\n\nRemember to adjust the amount of grapefruit juice and orange liqueur to your taste, as they can be quite potent. And don't be afraid to experiment with different types of grapefruit juice, such as pink or ruby red, to see how they affect the flavor profile.\n\nAlso, if you want to take your Tequila Sour to the next level, you could try using a flavored simple syrup, such as a citrus or spice-infused syrup, to add an extra layer of depth to the cocktail.\n\nHave fun during your class, and I hope your experiments turn out amazing!

It's a cozy spot with a few tables and chairs, surrounded by plants and umbrellas to provide some shade. It's the perfect spot to soak up some morning sun and fresh air while you catch up with Alex.\n\nKeep in mind that the outdoor seating area is relatively small, so it's possible that it might be busy on a nice Saturday morning. However, the inside of the cafe is also very comfortable, and you can always grab a table by the window if the patio is full.\n\nOne more thing to note is that The Daily Grind is a popular spot, so it's a good idea to arrive fairly early to grab a table, especially if you're planning to sit outside. But I'm sure you'll be able to find a spot to enjoy your coffee and conversation with Alex.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a great time at The Daily Grind!",

While they don't typically take reservations, I recommend calling ahead to check their wait times and availability. You can also try using online reservation platforms like Yelp or OpenTable to see if they have any available tables.\n\nIf you're planning to go with a large group, it's a good idea to call ahead and give them a heads up. They might be able to accommodate you, but be prepared for a possible wait.\n\n**Ordering at a BBQ Joint:**\n\nAt Smokey's, you'll typically order at the counter and then grab a seat. Here's how it usually works:\n\n1. **Line up**: Get in line and take a look at the menu board or printed menus available.\n2. **Order at the counter**: When you reach the front of the line, let the staff know what you'd like to order. Be prepared to specify the type and quantity of meat, sides, and any additional items like drinks or desserts.\n3. **Pay and pick up**: Pay for your order and grab a number or receipt. They'll call your number when your order is ready.\n4. **Grab a seat**: Find a table, and they'll bring your food out to you.\n\nSome tips for ordering at a BBQ joint:\n\n* **Know what you want**: Take a look at the menu beforehand and decide what you'd like to order. This will help you navigate the line more efficiently.\n* **Be prepared for questions**: The staff might ask you questions about your order, such as \"Do you want sauce on your meat?\" or \"Would you like that as a sandwich or a plate?\" Be ready to respond.\n* **Don't be afraid to ask**: If you're unsure about something, ask the staff for recommendations or clarification. They're there to help!\n* **Be patient**: BBQ joints can get busy, especially during peak hours. Be prepared to wait a bit for your food, and enjoy the atmosphere while you wait.\n\nHave a great time at Smokey's, and I hope you enjoy the 'cue!",
