Venue and Logistics: Securing a venue and arranging for travel and accommodations can be time-consuming tasks that require attention to detail. The effort required for this category will depend on the complexity of the logistics and the number of participants involved. A rough estimate for this category could be between 10-20% of the total effort required for the project.\n3. Program Design and Development: Developing a program curriculum and materials, and identifying and recruiting program facilitators can be complex tasks that require subject matter expertise.
