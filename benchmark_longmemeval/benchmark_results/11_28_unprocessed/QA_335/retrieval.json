That's a great way to stay on top of fare changes.\n\nNow, about your question: whether to book the Lufthansa ticket at $850 return from NY to Frankfurt or wait for prices to drop.\n\nHere are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Price trend**: Have you noticed any recent price drops or increases on your desired route? If prices have been steadily increasing, it might be a good idea to book now. If they've been decreasing, you could wait a bit longer.\n2. **Flexibility**: How flexible are your travel dates? If you have specific dates in mind, it's generally better to book earlier to ensure availability. If you have flexibility, you can wait and see if prices drop.\n3. **Lufthansa's pricing**: Lufthansa is a full-service carrier, and their prices tend to be more stable than low-cost carriers like Norwegian Air. If you're comfortable with the $850 price point, it might be a good time to book.\n4. **Norwegian Air's prices**: How do Norwegian Air's prices compare to Lufthansa's? If they're significantly cheaper, you might want to consider waiting to see if Lufthansa's prices drop to match or beat Norwegian's.\n5. **Summer is peak season**: June to August is peak travel season in Europe, which means prices tend to be higher. If you're traveling during this time, it's unlikely that prices will drop significantly.\n6. **Booking window**: Generally, the optimal time to book a flight is 54 days in advance, according to Skyscanner's data. If you're within that window, it might be a good time to book.\n\nConsidering these factors, if you're comfortable with the $850 price point and don't expect prices to drop significantly, it might be a good time to book the Lufthansa ticket.\n\nRegarding the American Airlines email about the potential class-action lawsuit, that's an interesting side note! While it's not directly related to your travel plans, it's always good to stay informed about loyalty program changes and potential lawsuits that might affect your travel experiences.\n\nFeel free to provide more details about your travel plans, and I'll do my best to help you make an informed decision!",

While I don't have access to your personal account information, I can provide general information about United Airlines' loyalty program and promotions.\n\nAs a MileagePlus member, you're likely to receive exclusive offers and discounts. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **MileagePlus promotions:** United Airlines often runs promotions for frequent flyers, offering discounts on specific routes, fare sales, or package deals. Keep an eye on your email inbox and the United Airlines website for these promotions.\n2. **Fare sales:** United Airlines occasionally offers fare sales, which can be a great opportunity to save on your Las Vegas trip. These sales are usually announced via email or on their website.\n3. **Upgrade offers:** As a frequent flyer, you might receive upgrade offers to Economy Plus or premium cabins, depending on availability. These offers can be a great way to experience a higher level of service at a discounted rate.\n4. ** Bundle and save:** United Airlines sometimes offers discounts when you bundle flights, hotels, and car rentals together. This can be a cost-effective way to plan your Las Vegas trip.\n5. **MileagePlus awards:** With 20,000 miles, you might be able to redeem an award ticket or upgrade to a higher cabin. You can explore your award options on the United Airlines website.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a discount or promotion, I recommend:\n\n* **Logging into your MileagePlus account:** Check your account dashboard for personalized offers and promotions.\n* **Subscribing to United Airlines' email newsletter:** Stay informed about sales, promotions, and exclusive offers.\n* **Following United Airlines on social media:** Keep an eye on their social media channels for flash sales and limited-time offers.\n* **Using travel credit cards:** If you have a United Airlines-affiliated credit card, you might earn more miles or receive exclusive discounts.\n\nRemember to always compare prices and promotions across different airlines to ensure you're getting the best deal for your Las Vegas trip.\n\nLastly, since you've accumulated 20,000 miles, you might want to consider redeeming some of them for a flight upgrade or award ticket. This could be a great way to experience a higher level of service or save some money on your trip.",

While I don't have access to your personal account information, I can provide general information about United Airlines' loyalty program, MileagePlus, and its benefits.\n\nUnited Airlines has a tier-based loyalty program, with Premier status levels ranging from Silver to 1K. The benefits and perks you're eligible for depend on your status level, which is determined by the number of Premier Qualifying Miles (PQMs) or Premier Qualifying Segments (PQSs) you earn within a calendar year.\n\nSince you've accumulated around 20,000 miles in the past three months, you might be on your way to achieving a higher status level. Here are some general benefits and perks you might be interested in:\n\n* **Silver status** (25,000 PQMs or 30 PQSs): Enjoy benefits like priority check-in, security screening, and boarding, as well as one free checked bag.\n* **Gold status** (50,000 PQMs or 60 PQSs): In addition to Silver benefits, Gold members get two free checked bags, priority baggage handling, and access to Economy Plus seating at check-in.\n* **Platinum status** (75,000 PQMs or 90 PQSs): Platinum members receive all Gold benefits, plus access to United Polaris business class lounges, Star Alliance Gold status, and higher upgrade priority.\n* **1K status** (100,000 PQMs or 120 PQSs): 1K members enjoy all Platinum benefits, plus perks like personalized service, dedicated check-in and security lines, and highest upgrade priority.\n\nAssuming you're not yet a Premier member, you might not have access to these benefits just yet. However, as you continue to accumulate miles, you'll be closer to achieving a higher status level.\n\nIn the meantime, as a MileagePlus member, you can still enjoy some benefits, such as:\n\n* Earning miles on flights and redeeming them for award travel, upgrades, or other rewards\n* Access to United's online check-in and mobile check-in\n* Priority boarding (based on your group assignment)\n* Opportunities to purchase upgrades or Economy Plus seating\n\nKeep in mind that benefits and perks are subject to change, and United Airlines may offer additional promotions or limited-time offers. I recommend logging into your MileagePlus account or contacting United Airlines' customer service to get the most up-to-date information on your benefits and status.\n\nLastly, since you mentioned being impressed with United's in-flight entertainment system, you might be interested in exploring their premium cabins, like Polaris business class or Premium Plus, on your next long-haul flight. These cabins offer enhanced comfort, amenities, and service, which might be worth considering for your next trip.",

This can help you identify the most affordable options for your travel dates.\n2. **Use fare comparison tools**: Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak allow you to compare prices across multiple airlines, including Southwest. You can set up price alerts to notify you when prices drop.\n3. **Consider flying into Oakland (OAK) instead**: If you're open to flying into Oakland International Airport instead of SFO, you might find cheaper flights. Oakland is about 30 miles from San Francisco, and you can take a shuttle or Uber to get to the city.\n4. **Look for Southwest Airlines sales**: Keep an eye on Southwest's website and social media for sales or promotions. They often offer discounts or special deals, especially during off-peak travel seasons.\n5. **Book in advance**: The earlier you book your flight, the better your chances of getting a good deal. Southwest Airlines typically increases prices as the flight approaches, so it's a good idea to book at least 2-3 weeks in advance.\n\nSince you mentioned you took a direct flight with Southwest from your hometown to Las Vegas, I'm assuming you know your hometown airport. If you're willing to share that information, I can provide more specific flight options and prices for your San Francisco trip.\n\nRemember to also factor in any additional costs, such as baggage fees, seat selection, or rental cars, when comparing prices.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",

Drinks, including beer and wine, are also free.\n* **Premium Economy:**\n\t+ Seat pitch: 38 inches (97 cm), which is more spacious than economy.\n\t+ Seat width: 19 inches (48 cm), which is wider than economy.\n\t+ Priority check-in, boarding, and luggage handling.\n\t+ Upgraded meal service, including more options and higher-quality ingredients.\n* **Business Class:**\n\t+ Lie-flat beds or fully flat beds (depending on the aircraft), with a comfortable sleeping surface.\n\t+ Priority check-in, boarding, and luggage handling.\n\t+ Gourmet meal service, with fine wines and champagne.\n\t+ Access to Lufthansa's business lounges.\n\n**Other Perks:**\n\n* **Lufthansa's Hubs:** Frankfurt Airport (FRA) and Munich Airport (MUC) are well-connected hubs with modern facilities, making connections relatively seamless.\n* **Loyalty Program:** Lufthansa's Miles & More program is part of the Star Alliance, allowing you to earn and redeem miles across multiple airlines.\n* **In-flight Wi-Fi:** Lufthansa offers Wi-Fi on many of its aircraft, with prices starting at €9.90 (around $11 USD) for a one-hour pass.\n\nOverall, Lufthansa is known for its reliable service, comfortable amenities, and efficient operations.

I'd be happy to break down their checked baggage fees and policies for you.\n\n**Checked Baggage Fees:**\n\nUnited Airlines charges fees for checked bags, which vary depending on your route, travel dates, and MileagePlus status. Here's a general overview:\n\n* **First checked bag:**\n\t+ Economy: $30 online, $40 at airport (free for Premier members and Star Alliance Gold members)\n\t+ Basic Economy: Not allowed (only one personal item is permitted)\n* **Second checked bag:**\n\t+ Economy: $40 online, $50 at airport (free for Premier Platinum and 1K members, as well as Star Alliance Gold members)\n\t+ Basic Economy: Not allowed\n* **Additional checked bags (3+):**\n\t+ Economy: $150 each online, $160 each at airport\n\t+ Basic Economy: Not allowed\n\n**Checked Baggage Policies:**\n\nHere are some important details to keep in mind:\n\n* **Weight and size restrictions:** Checked bags must weigh 50 pounds (23 kg) or less and measure 62 linear inches (157 cm) or less.\n* **Exceptional items:** Some items, like surfboards, bicycles, or musical instruments, may require special handling and additional fees.\n* **Overweight bags:** Bags exceeding 50 pounds (23 kg) will incur additional fees, ranging from $100 to $200 per bag.\n* **Oversized bags:** Bags larger than 62 linear inches (157 cm) will incur additional fees, ranging from $200 to $400 per bag.\n\n**MileagePlus Benefits:**\n\nAs a frequent flyer, you might be eligible for some baggage perks:\n\n* **Premier members:** Enjoy free checked bags, depending on your status level (Silver, Gold, Platinum, or 1K).\n* **Star Alliance Gold members:** Receive free checked bags on United and Star Alliance-operated flights.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* **Check your ticket:** Verify your baggage allowance and fees when booking your ticket or checking in online.\n* **Pre-pay for bags:** Pay for your checked bags online to save money compared to airport prices.\n* **Pack wisely:** Ensure your bags meet the weight and size restrictions to avoid additional fees.\n\nSince you took four flights with United last month, you might want to review your ticket receipts or check your MileagePlus account to see if you were charged for any checked bags. Additionally, consider using a credit card or loyalty program that offers baggage fee credits or reimbursements to offset these costs.\n\nI hope this helps you navigate United's baggage policy! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",
