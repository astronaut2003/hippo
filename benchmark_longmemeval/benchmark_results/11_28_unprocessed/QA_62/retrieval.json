The quirky decor in the lobby is also a great touch - Kimpton hotels are known for their unique and stylish designs.\n\nIt's great that you're taking a more relaxed approach this time around. Sometimes, it's nice to slow down and enjoy the city at a leisurely pace. The Riverwalk is a beautiful place to take a stroll, and you can stop and admire the views, take some photos, or simply people-watch.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you could also consider taking a boat tour or a stroll along the Lakefront Trail, which runs along the shores of Lake Michigan. The views of the city skyline from the lake are simply stunning.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, I hope you have a wonderful time in Chicago and enjoy your relaxed approach to exploring the city!",
