      "memory": "\"Stairway to Heaven\" was written by British rock band Led Zeppelin's guitarist Jimmy Page and vocalist Robert Plant. The song was released in 1971 and is considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time.\n\nThe lyrics of the song are often interpreted as describing a journey from materialism and earthly concerns to spiritual enlightenment. The song is divided into several sections, each with its own distinct musical style.\n\nThe opening lines, \"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold / And she's buying a stairway to heaven\" introduce the main character of the song, a materialistic woman who believes that she can attain spiritual fulfillment through material possessions. The song then progresses to describe a journey through different stages of life and ends with an instrumental section known as the \"guitar solo.\"\n\nMany elements of the song, such as the references to \"the May Queen\" and \"the piper,\" are thought to draw inspiration from Celtic mythology. The song's iconic guitar riff was reportedly inspired by a piece called \"Taurus\" by the band Spirit.\n\nOverall, \"Stairway to Heaven\" is seen as a masterpiece of 1970s rock and has influenced countless musicians and listeners over the past few decades.",
