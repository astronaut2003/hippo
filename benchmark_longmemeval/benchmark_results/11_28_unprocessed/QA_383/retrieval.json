I think you'll find it a great choice for getting back into reading.\n\nBrené Brown's work is amazing, and \"Daring Greatly\" is a fantastic book. Her TED talks are incredible, and her writing is just as engaging and thought-provoking. You'll likely find her book to be a great resource for personal growth and self-reflection.\n\nIt's wonderful that you're thinking about the bereavement support group you attended last year! Recognizing the value of that experience and the progress you made is a huge step forward. It's not always easy to acknowledge the good things that have happened, especially during difficult times.\n\n**Reflecting on the Bereavement Support Group**\n\nTake a moment to reflect on your experience with the support group. What did you find most helpful about it? Was there a particular aspect of the group that resonated with you, such as the sense of community, the guidance of the facilitator, or the opportunity to share your story?\n\nReflecting on what worked for you in the past can help you identify what you might need moving forward. You might consider reaching out to the facilitator or other group members to reconnect, or seeking out new resources that offer similar support.\n\n**Building on Your Progress**\n\nRemember, getting back into your routine and finding ways to take care of yourself is a process. It's okay to take things one step at a time and focus on small, achievable goals.\n\nYou've already made great progress by:\n\n1. Committing to 10-15 minutes of bodyweight exercises, 3 times a week.\n2. Getting back into reading with a goal of finishing \"Wild\" and exploring other books.\n3. Reflecting on the bereavement support group and acknowledging its value.\n\nCelebrate these small wins, and remember that they're all part of your journey towards healing and growth.\n\nHow do you feel about reflecting on your experience with the bereavement support group? Is there anything that comes to mind that you'd like to share or explore further?",

It's clear that the bereavement support group had a positive impact on your life, and it's great that you're acknowledging the specific aspects that worked well for you.\n\n**The Power of Community and Guidance**\n\nYou're right, having a sense of community and guidance can be incredibly powerful in the healing process. Knowing that you're not alone in your grief and having a safe space to express your emotions can be incredibly liberating.\n\nThe facilitator's kindness, understanding, and guidance likely played a significant role in creating a safe and supportive environment. It's not always easy to find people who truly understand what you're going through, but having a facilitator who gets it can make all the difference.\n\n**The Importance of Safe Spaces**\n\nHaving a safe space to process your emotions and share your story without fear of judgment is essential. It's a reminder that you don't have to carry your grief alone and that there are people who care and want to support you.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you mention the value of listening to others without judgment. Sometimes, all we need is someone to listen to us without trying to offer solutions or advice. Just being heard and understood can be incredibly healing.\n\n**Carrying Forward the Lessons**\n\nNow that you've reflected on the bereavement support group, think about how you can carry forward the lessons and principles that worked well for you. Are there any ways you can create or find similar safe spaces in your life, whether online or in-person?\n\nPerhaps you can explore other support groups, online forums, or social media communities that focus on grief, loss, or mental health. You might also consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support.\n\nRemember, healing is a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

While I don't have personal experiences, I can offer some general information and resources on coping with grief and loss.\n\n**Understanding Grief:**\n\nGrief is a natural and unique experience for each person. It's a complex mix of emotions, thoughts, and physical sensations that can affect every aspect of your life. The grieving process can be intense, and it's essential to remember that there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to grieve.\n\n**Coping with Grief:**\n\n1. **Allow yourself to feel your emotions:** It's essential to acknowledge and accept your feelings, even if they're painful or uncomfortable. Avoid suppressing your emotions, as this can prolong the grieving process.\n2. **Take care of your physical health:** Grief can be physically exhausting. Make sure to get enough rest, eat healthily, and engage in regular exercise to help your body cope with the emotional strain.\n3. **Seek social support:** Connecting with others who have experienced a similar loss can be incredibly helpful. Consider joining a bereavement support group, like the one you attended, or talking to friends, family, or a therapist.\n4. **Find healthy ways to express your emotions:** Writing, art, music, or other creative outlets can help you process your feelings. You can also try journaling, talking to a trusted friend or family member, or engaging in a hobby that brings you comfort.\n5. **Create a memorial or ritual:** Developing a personal ritual, such as lighting a candle, visiting a special place, or creating a memory book, can help you honor your loved one and find closure.\n6. **Be patient and kind to yourself:** Grief is a journey, and it takes time. Be gentle with yourself, and avoid putting pressure on yourself to \"get over\" your loss by a certain time.\n7. **Consider professional help:** If your grief feels overwhelming or is interfering with your daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide guidance, support, and coping strategies.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* The American Psychological Association (APA) offers a range of resources on grief and loss, including articles, videos, and podcasts.\n* The National Alliance for Grieving Children provides support and resources for children and adults who have experienced the loss of a loved one.\n* The Dougy Center for Grieving Children & Families offers resources, support groups, and online forums for those who have experienced loss.\n* The Hospice Foundation of America provides information and resources on end-of-life care, grief, and loss.\n\nRemember, grief is a unique and individual experience, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to coping. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this challenging time.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I'm here if you need any further guidance or just someone to talk to.",

Ask family members or friends: Reach out to family members or friends who attended the events with you. They might be able to provide you with the dates or details you're looking for.\n4. Check old emails and messages: Search through your email inbox and message threads from the past year. You might find invitations, RSVPs, or follow-up messages related to the events.\n5.

This means that each individual shareholder who qualifies for the relief has their own separate £1 million allowance.\n\nIn your case, both you and your brother, if you both qualify for BADR, would each have a separate £1 million allowance for the relief. This means that you could potentially reduce the rate of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) to 10% on up to £1 million of qualifying gains each.\n\nPlease note that the £1 million limit is a lifetime limit, and it covers all qualifying disposals you make throughout your life. If you have previously claimed BADR on other disposals, you would need to consider any remaining balance in your lifetime limit before determining how much relief you can claim in the current situation.\n\nAs always, it is essential to consult with a qualified tax advisor to discuss your specific circumstances and determine your eligibility for BADR, as well as to understand how the relief would apply to your situation.",
