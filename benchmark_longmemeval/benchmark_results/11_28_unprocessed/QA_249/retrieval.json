      "memory": "题目：Walmart: inflation oration\nLEX., Financial Times, 17 November 2021\nWho’s afraid of the big, bad price rise? Not Americans. US inflation may have hit a 31-year high in October. But consumers are still eager to spend.\nThis should be good news for Walmart. The world’s biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer reported strong third-quarter sales and raised its full-year outlook. Supply-chain disruptions and fears of empty shelves are prompting many Americans to get a head start on their holiday shopping.\nDo not be fooled by the topline growth. There are reasons that shares in Walmart have gone nowhere this year. The stock is down 3 per cent, compared with the 48 per cent gains at rivals Target and Home Depot.\nTo ensure that its shelves are stocked for the holidays, Walmart has taken drastic measures, including using air freight and chartering its own cargo ships. This has helped it to increase US inventory 11.5 per cent in the quarter.\nThat has come at a cost. Gross quarterly margins fell 42 basis points to 24.6 per cent. This compares with 34.1 per cent at Home Depot and the 30 per cent posted by Target.\nPressure will persist. Labour shortages mean low-wage Walmart will need to pay up for workers. Home Depot sells bulky items that cannot be readily ordered from Amazon. Target has strong in-house brands that help protect margins. But Walmart is more exposed to the inflationary squeeze.\nMany of the products it carries can readily be bought elsewhere.\nWalmart still trades at a premium to Target, which is on 21 times forward earnings. But the\nvaluation has fallen from 27 to 23 times over the past year.\nTo break out of rangebound trading, Walmart will have to find new sources of growth. Potential\ncatalysts include Walmart’s ad unit and its marketplace business where third-party vendors sell their wares. Walmart, once written off as a doomed physical retailer, has staged a remarkable recovery. The era of rising inflation means another reinvention is required.\n请用到上面的模版完成这道题目，用英文2 / 2",

      "memory": "Wood pellets are a popular alternative to logs, chips, and chunks, and they offer some unique benefits. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**What are Wood Pellets?**\n\n* Wood pellets are small, compressed pellets made from dried and processed wood fibers, sawdust, and other wood byproducts.\n* They're typically made from hardwoods like oak, hickory, and maple, but can also be made from softwoods like pine or fir.\n* Wood pellets are designed to be a convenient, easy-to-use fuel source for smoking, grilling, and cooking.\n\n**Advantages of Wood Pellets:**\n\n* **Convenience:** Wood pellets are easy to use and require minimal effort. Simply add them to your smoker or grill, and they'll start producing smoke.\n* **Consistency:** Wood pellets burn consistently and produce a consistent smoke flavor, which is ideal for low-and-slow cooking.\n* **Efficiency:** Wood pellets are highly efficient, producing more smoke and heat from less material.\n* **Space-Saving:** Wood pellets take up less storage space than logs, chips, or chunks, making them ideal for small smokers or grillers.\n* **Cost-Effective:** Wood pellets can be more cost-effective than logs or chunks, especially for frequent smokers.\n\n**Comparison to Logs, Chips, and Chunks:**\n\n* **Smoking Time:** Wood pellets produce smoke faster than logs, but slower than chips. They're ideal for medium-to-long smoke times (4-8 hours).\n* **Flavor Profile:** Wood pellets produce a milder smoke flavor compared to logs or chunks, but stronger than chips. They're perfect for those who prefer a subtle smoke flavor.\n* **Heat Output:** Wood pellets produce a moderate amount of heat, making them suitable for low-and-slow cooking, but not ideal for high-heat grilling.\n* **Moisture Content:** Wood pellets have a lower moisture content than logs or chunks, which means they burn more efficiently and produce less creosote buildup.\n\n**Tips for Using Wood Pellets:**\n\n* Use a pellet smoker or a pellet tube to contain the pellets and direct the smoke.\n* Soak the pellets in water for 30 minutes to 1 hour before use to help them burn more efficiently.\n* Start with a small amount (about 1 cup) and adjust as needed to achieve the desired smoke flavor.\n* Mix and match different types of wood pellets to create a unique flavor profile.\n\nOverall, wood pellets offer a convenient, efficient, and cost-effective way to add smoke flavor to your meats. They're a great option for those who want a hassle-free smoking experience with consistent results.",

      "memory": "Wood chips and chunks are a great way to add smoky flavor to your meats, and they're often easier to use than logs. Here's the difference between them and how to use them:\n\n**Wood Chips:**\n\n* Wood chips are small, thin pieces of wood that are typically 1-2 inches long and 1/4 inch thick.\n* They're great for adding a quick burst of smoke flavor to your meats, especially during the last 30 minutes to 1 hour of cooking.\n* Wood chips are perfect for smaller smokers or for adding flavor to meats that don't require a long smoke time.\n* They ignite quickly and burn fast, producing a lot of smoke in a short amount of time.\n\n**Wood Chunks:**\n\n* Wood chunks are larger pieces of wood that are typically 2-4 inches long and 1-2 inches thick.\n* They're great for adding a deeper, more sustained smoke flavor to your meats, especially during longer smoke times.\n* Wood chunks are perfect for larger smokers or for meats that require a longer smoke time, like brisket or pork shoulders.\n* They burn slower than wood chips, producing a more consistent smoke flavor over a longer period.\n\n**How to Use Wood Chips and Chunks:**\n\n* Soak the wood chips or chunks in water for at least 30 minutes before using them. This helps them burn more slowly and produce a cleaner smoke flavor.\n* Add the wood chips or chunks to your smoker, either directly on the coals or in a smoker box.\n* For wood chips, you can add them in small handfuls every 30 minutes to 1 hour to maintain a consistent smoke flavor.\n* For wood chunks, you can add them at the beginning of the smoke time and let them burn slowly throughout the cooking process.\n* You can also mix and match different types of wood chips and chunks to create a unique flavor profile.\n\nSome general guidelines for using wood chips and chunks:\n\n* For a mild smoke flavor, use 1-2 cups of wood chips or 1-2 chunks per hour of cooking time.\n* For a medium smoke flavor, use 2-3 cups of wood chips or 2-3 chunks per hour of cooking time.\n* For a strong smoke flavor, use 3-4 cups of wood chips or 3-4 chunks per hour of cooking time.\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions for your specific smoker, and adjust the amount of wood chips or chunks based on your personal taste preferences.

The hickory adds a strong, sweet, and smoky flavor, while the apple wood contributes a mild, fruity flavor. The ratio of hickory to apple wood pellets can vary depending on your personal taste preferences, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n**Hickory-Heavy Blend:**\n\n* 70% Hickory Pellets: 30% Apple Wood Pellets\n\nThis blend is ideal for those who prefer a stronger, more traditional smoke flavor. The hickory will dominate the flavor profile, with the apple wood adding a subtle sweetness.\n\n**Balanced Blend:**\n\n* 50% Hickory Pellets: 50% Apple Wood Pellets\n\nThis blend provides a nice balance between the strong, smoky flavor of hickory and the mild, fruity flavor of apple wood. It's a great option for those who want a balanced smoke flavor.\n\n**Apple-Forward Blend:**\n\n* 30% Hickory Pellets: 70% Apple Wood Pellets\n\nThis blend is perfect for those who prefer a milder smoke flavor with a fruity twist. The apple wood will dominate the flavor profile, with the hickory adding a subtle smokiness.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Start with a smaller amount of hickory pellets (20-30%) and adjust to taste. Hickory can overpower the flavor of the meat if used in excess.\n* Experiment with different ratios of hickory to apple wood pellets to find your perfect blend.\n* Consider adding a small amount of other wood pellets, like cherry or oak, to create a unique flavor profile.\n* Remember that the type and quality of pellets can affect the flavor, so choose high-quality pellets from a reputable manufacturer.\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions for use and storage to ensure the best results from your wood pellets.
