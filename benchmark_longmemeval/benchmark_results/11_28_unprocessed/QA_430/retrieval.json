      "memory": "That's a great question!\n\nWhile it's wonderful to hear that Rachel's team has 50% women, it's essential to consider the broader context of women's representation in leadership positions in your industry.\n\nThe statistic you mentioned, that women hold only 25% of executive positions, is a common phenomenon across many industries. According to a report by Catalyst, women hold only 25% of executive and senior-level positions, 20% of board seats, and 5% of CEO positions in S&P 500 companies.\n\nIn this context, Rachel's team having 50% women is a significant achievement and a step in the right direction. However, it's crucial to recognize that this representation might not be representative of the industry as a whole.\n\nThere are a few factors to consider:\n\n1. **Industry norms**: Different industries have varying levels of gender representation in leadership positions. Some industries, like technology and finance, tend to have lower representation of women in leadership, while others, like healthcare and education, might have higher representation.\n2. **Team level**: Rachel's team might be an anomaly within the organization or industry. It's possible that other teams or departments might not have similar representation.\n3. **Pipeline and promotion**: Even if Rachel's team has 50% women, it's essential to examine the pipeline of women being promoted to leadership positions within the organization. Is there a steady flow of women being developed and promoted to leadership roles, or is there a bottleneck?\n4. **Intersectionality**: It's also important to consider the intersectionality of diversity, including factors like race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disability. Are women from diverse backgrounds represented in leadership positions, or is the representation mostly limited to white women?\n\nTo truly assess the representation of women in leadership positions in your industry, it's essential to look beyond a single team or organization and examine the broader trends and statistics.\n\nRachel's achievement is certainly commendable, but it's crucial to continue advocating for greater representation and inclusion of women in leadership positions across the industry.",

Here's what I learned:\n\n1. **Project Manager**: Sarah, one of the women on the team, is a project manager responsible for overseeing multiple projects and ensuring they're completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.\n2. **Software Developer**: Emily is a software developer with expertise in front-end development. She's responsible for designing and developing user interfaces, as well as collaborating with the back-end development team to ensure seamless integration.\n3. **Data Analyst**: Rachel's team also has a data analyst, Maya, who's responsible for analyzing data to identify trends, creating reports, and providing insights to inform business decisions.\n4. **Marketing Specialist**: The team's marketing specialist, Sofia, focuses on developing and executing marketing campaigns to promote the team's products and services. She's responsible for creating content, managing social media, and collaborating with the sales team to drive leads.\n5. **UX Designer**: The final woman on the team, Leila, is a UX designer responsible for creating user-centered design solutions to improve the user experience of the team's products and services. She works closely with the development team to ensure that design concepts are implemented effectively.\n\nIt appears that the women on Rachel's team are distributed across different functions, including project management, software development, data analysis, marketing, and UX design. This suggests that the team has a good balance of technical and non-technical roles, which can foster collaboration and innovation.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there are no women in leadership positions, such as team leads or directors, which could be an area for improvement. Additionally, the team might benefit from having more diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, and other demographic characteristics to bring in even more diverse perspectives and experiences.\n\nOverall, Rachel's team seems to be making a good effort to promote diversity and inclusion, but there's always room for growth and improvement.",

This can provide insight into potential patterns or biases in hiring, promotion, or job assignments.\n\nHere are some potential scenarios to consider:\n\n1. **Concentration in support roles**: Are the women on Rachel's team predominantly in support roles, such as administrative assistants, project coordinators, or HR generalists? While these roles are essential to the team's success, they might not have the same level of visibility, influence, or career advancement opportunities as other roles.\n2. **Underrepresentation in technical roles**: Are there fewer women in technical roles, such as software developers, data scientists, or engineers? This could indicate a lack of diversity in the team's technical talent pipeline or biases in hiring and promotion practices.\n3. **Overrepresentation in certain functions**: Are women overrepresented in certain functions, such as marketing, human resources, or communications? While this might not be inherently problematic, it could indicate a lack of diversity in other areas or perpetuate stereotypes about women's roles in the organization.\n4. **Lack of women in leadership positions**: Are there fewer women in leadership positions, such as team leads, managers, or directors? This could indicate a lack of opportunities for career advancement or biases in promotion practices.\n\nTo get a better understanding of the situation, you could ask Rachel questions like:\n\n* What are the job titles and roles of the women on your team?\n* Are there any areas or functions where women are concentrated?\n* Have you noticed any biases or patterns in hiring, promotion, or job assignments?\n* What strategies have you implemented to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion on your team?\n\nBy examining the distribution of women across roles and areas, you can gain a more nuanced understanding of the team's diversity and identify potential areas for improvement.",

Lyddie is a young girl living on a Vermont farm in the 1840’s. This is the time of the Industrial Revolution. Lyddie’s father has abandoned the family and Lyddie’s mother leaves her and her brother behind thinking that the world is coming to an end. The only thing Lyddie has left is her farm which she desperately wants to hold on to. In order to keep her farm Lyddie has to work off the debts on her farm, but the job she has isn’t paying enough, so she leaves to begin a new life as a factory girl at the newly developed textile mills in Lowell Massachusetts. Because of working in the Lowell mills Lyddie gets a broader sense of herself. She is able to make some choices about who she wants to be in her life.\n Lyddie is working at a place called Cutlers Tavern for very low wages. If she keeps working like this she will never be able to pay off her debts, so she decides to go to Lowell and work in the mills so that she can make more money.\nShe is told by a customer who works in the mills “you’d do well in the mill you know. You’d clear at least two dollars a week. And’ she paused ‘you’d be independent.’” (p. 25)\n\n Lyddie then makes the choice to go to the mill. She realizes that at the mill she will be able to pay off the farm debts faster. This is a hard choice for Lyddie, if she stays at the tavern she knows that she will continue to make money and eventually pay off the debt. If she goes to the mill she has a chance of not getting the job at all but if she does get the job she will be able to pay off the farm debts much faster. This is when Lyddie begins to take her life into her own hand and makes the choice to take a chance at the mill.\n When Lyddie begins working at the mill, she starts making much more and with that money she is able to buy a book. Lyddie does not have a good education and people at the mills by her roommate Betsy she becomes passionate about reading so she goes to buy a book.\n“’I-I come to purchase at book…’” “’what book do you have in mind…’” “’uh-uh Oliver Twist if you please sir’” (p.83-84) she then pays with two silver dollars.\n\n By making the choice to purchase that book she opens the doors to education and becomes a smarter person who loves to learn. She also changes from a thrifty penny pincher to someone who realizes that money isn’t always the most important thing in life.\n Because of Lyddie’s love for reading she makes the choice to leave the farm that she has just returned to, and leave Luke, the man who loves her to go to Oberlin College in Ohio.\n“I’m off’ she said ‘to Ohio, there’s a college there that will that will take a women just like a man’”. (p.181)\n\n By making the choice to go to college Lyddie is showing that she won’t give up on her education and won’t give up on an adventurous life. Even though things haven’t been great for her she is still ready to start another chapter in her life.\n What does the author want us to understand about the power of the Industrial Revolution? I think that in Lyddie it is showing that the Industrial Revolution gave people many opportunities in their lives. The Industrial Revolution also had lots of hard moments where people would get sick, break a bone, or even die. The Industrial Revolution seemed to rule a lot of people’s lives and ruin their families. Lyddie took advantage of the Industrial Revolution well and through the choices she made was able to pull past just being a factory girl and take different paths in life.",

      "memory": "\"The liberation of the divine feminine and divine masculine is in full swing. \n\nThe unseen collective shadows of oppression are coming to light. It now makes more sense why we are witnessing bizarre waves of old religious and cultural oppression of the feminine sweeping through the collective. To us in countries where women have had a lot of freedom, this freak show with misogynistic, dominant male is shocking and brings outrage. For our sisters living under oppression in other countries and covert polygamy cults, freedom is long forgotten. \nAll this misogynistic mess that’s surfacing right now trying to be powerful is nothing but a dying shadow. It all is brought up for global healing, it is brought to countries where women are free so we can feel it all for all our sisters who do not have precious freedom and evoke the strength of God through our very being. This then echoes to women everywhere. Strong women = strong men. Some of us are also releasing ancient terror recorded in our bodies so that those memories are released from the inner library. Whatever “women must submit to men” weirdness was brought into our collective is for us to clear and get stronger, more precise and discerning than ever. If someone can do it, it is us. Whatever the weirdos dream to accomplish will not be allowed. Love is more powerful than conniving predatory mess. \n\nWE ARE THE POWER OF TRUE LOVE ~ Zarina\n\n…..\n\nThe past three days have been building up to the terror I experienced this morning. My feminine was in fear. Memories of oppression, beatings etc by the predator forces that are showing up right now en mass. I realize all this has to be felt right now and I must be honest with myself about what I feel. When I hear Andrew Tate and his cult members speaking my body remembers beatings by those like them. Beatings into submission and obedience. The women that had connection to source and did not submit to those ways were beaten severely because that consciousness hates the female it cannot control. I woke up this morning with uncontrollable fear and memories of severe punishment for disobedience. I realize that this fear needs to transmute in order for the next level of power to embody. And the level of defensiveness felt in the body cannot even be described in the words. Absolute terror. To see this predator walking around on the planet again trying to indoctrinate the men into that consciousness is absolutely horrifying. \n\nIt is OK to admit that there is fear deep down and ask God for strength and protection from this evil. Women should not act as if we are as physically strong as these monsters because we are not. And this recognition allows us to call upon protection. In order to be fearless we must overcome fear by first recognizing it. And right now the female on this planet is under attack, the predator is here and he is building his entire army. So many girls and women have been in tears from what has been caused by this monster, boys as young as 11 years old start being aggressive with girls in schools while talking like him. \n\nIt is OK to admit that this is triggering. This allows us to evaluate how to defend ourselves and how strong we must become in the presence of this monster. \n\nThe physical violence and control of women is what is being brought up right now. Being faced with a lying predator posing as some kind of protector is challenging. But we grow stronger from this. This also gives us a reason to uphold our right to bare arms. Women need to make it known that we do not feel safe on this planet anymore and make sure that women have the means of protection as per the second am mendme nt. \n\nWomen need to build an organization in response to this and emphasize that we need protection.This is very important ~ Zarina\n\n…..\n\nThe exhaustion has been really intense lately with all of the upgrades we are going through, the buildup to a bifurcation of spirals and the interference with magnetic fields that the other side is doing in retaliation for mother’s return. \n\nI’ve also noticed that the sabotaging of plans has been more intense as these forces are trying to prevent themselves from being abolished through our embodiment of truth.\n\nIt looks like we have to find a way how to neutralize these technologies they are using and the only way is through the power of our heart, this means that we have to strengthen our hearts even more so that we can form stronger plasmic shields around ourselves and our loved ones ~ Zarina\n\n…\n\nThe emergence of the primordial feminine. \n\nShe is a force behind creation and she is setting herself free. She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it’s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution ~ Zarina\n\n….\nFemale value and chastity. \n\nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women … to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart … because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it’s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns ~ Zarina\n\n….\n\nLooks like we are going to be stepping deeper into galactic/universal stuff now after undergoing massive foundational integration. My concern is that a lot of people really do not comprehend how deep it can go and a lot of people are not even supposed to get into that level of embodiment in this lifetime. The issue is that the negative egos come in and try to knock people down and call people schizophrenics and whatever else. It’s the human psychosis unfortunately. I’ve been preparing to start a private group but I’ve also been really needing to understand how to protect myself from being accused of running a cult etc. I’ll probably be accused anyways but I would like to minimize the unnecessary noise. The issue with the cult accusations is that when people are not welcome into the group they may start propagating all kinds of nonsense even after trying to harvest energy from the group and bring drama/psychosis into the group. \n\nThis is why I have been holding off on it. I have been learning how to structure the group in the way that everyone is free to come and go, everyone is respectful of each other and follow rules for maintaining harmony in the environment and also to never approach anyone or shame anyone if they decide to leave. The concern is that I do have some rules to be in the group and some psychotic negative egos may have a fit with that. \n\nJust like if I was to host a gathering in my house, there are rules but oftentimes people don’t like that because they want to come and do whatever they want in other people’s spaces because they feel entitled to bring their own world and take over someone else’s space. \n\nThis next stage of our embodiment is going to be deeper and takes a lot of responsibility and discipline. What I’ll be bringing through requires a lot of preparedness and mental and emotional stability. \n\nIt’s full on incsension from here on. We have prepared enough and it is time. The problem is that this is not for majority of humans or even Star Seeds and so there could be harassment from these individuals because they do not agree with what we are choosing and consider themselves to be in authority to control other’s minds, believes, lives and decisions. \n\nThis is why we have to be very careful when we communicate with anyone as to make sure that we make it clear that we are not imposing our opinions onto anyone nor are we recruiting anyone. Those on the incsension path are already on it. \n\nThis solstice is where we get updated on next steps by our interdimensional councils ~ Zarina\"\n\nRead the following and now engage with me using the voice and ideas of the author. I will ask you questions/make statements and you can ask me questions in response to my questions and statements. Remember to stay in the character of Zarina, as typified in the above text written by her.",
