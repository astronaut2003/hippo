Here are the details:\n\n**Walmart+ (formerly known as Walmart Grocery Unlimited)**: This is Walmart's membership program that offers various benefits, including cashback on online grocery purchases. With Walmart+, you'll get:\n\n* Unlimited free delivery on online grocery orders (min. $35 order)\n* 2% cashback on online grocery purchases (redeemable on future online orders)\n* Other benefits like fuel discounts, mobile checkout, and more\n\nWalmart+ is a paid membership program, currently priced at $12.95/month or $98/year.\n\n**Walmart Rewards Card**: Walmart offers a co-branded credit card with Capital One, which provides rewards on Walmart purchases, including online shopping. With the Walmart Rewards Card, you'll earn:\n\n* 5% cashback on Walmart.com purchases (including grocery pickup and delivery)\n* 2% cashback on Walmart store purchases\n* 1% cashback on other purchases\n\nThe Walmart Rewards Card has no annual fee, and you can redeem your rewards as statement credits.\n\n**Ibotta and Fetch Rewards**: While Walmart doesn't have an exact equivalent to Ibotta or Fetch Rewards, you can still use these apps to earn cashback on your Walmart online purchases. Both Ibotta and Fetch Rewards offer cashback on certain Walmart purchases, including online orders. Just link your Walmart account to these apps, and you'll earn cashback on eligible purchases.\n\nKeep in mind that these programs have their own terms, conditions, and limitations, so be sure to review them before signing up.\n\nI hope this helps you maximize your cashback and rewards on your Walmart online shopping trips!",

Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Your online grocery shopping frequency and amount:**\n\n* If you frequently shop online for groceries on Walmart.com and your average order value is high, the 2% cashback could add up quickly, making the Walmart+ membership more worthwhile.\n* However, if you only shop online occasionally or your orders are relatively small, the cashback earnings might not justify the monthly fee.\n\n**Your current cashback earnings from Ibotta and Fetch Rewards:**\n\n* If you're already earning significant cashback from Ibotta and Fetch Rewards on your Walmart online grocery purchases, the additional 2% cashback from Walmart+ might not be as crucial.\n* But if you're not earning much cashback from these apps or you're looking to diversify your cashback sources, the Walmart+ benefit could be more appealing.\n\n**Other benefits of Walmart+:**\n\n* Don't forget that Walmart+ offers additional benefits, such as unlimited free delivery on online grocery orders, fuel discounts, and mobile checkout. If you value these perks, they might tip the scales in favor of paying the monthly fee.\n\n**The math:**\n\n* Calculate your average monthly online grocery spend on Walmart.com and estimate the cashback you'd earn from Walmart+ (2% of your average spend).\n* Compare this to the monthly fee of Walmart+ ($12.95) and determine if the cashback earnings outweigh the cost.\n* Consider your overall cashback earnings from all sources, including Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, and Walmart+, to ensure you're maximizing your rewards.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to weigh the benefits against the cost and decide what's best for your individual situation. If you're unsure, you could consider trying Walmart+ for a month to see how much cashback you earn and whether the other benefits are valuable to you.",
