      "memory": "The average lifespan of a portable power bank can vary depending on several factors, including the quality of the battery, usage patterns, and storage conditions. However, with regular use, you can expect a well-maintained power bank to last for around 2-3 years, with some lasting longer or shorter depending on the factors mentioned above.\n\nHere are some general guidelines to expect:\n\n1. **Cycle life**: A power bank's battery has a limited number of charge cycles it can handle before its capacity starts to degrade. A typical power bank battery can handle around 300-500 charge cycles. If you charge your power bank daily, it may last for around 1-2 years.\n2. **Capacity retention**: Over time, a power bank's capacity to hold a charge will decrease. A good quality power bank may retain around 80% of its original capacity after 1 year, and around 50% after 2 years.\n3. **Usage patterns**: If you use your power bank regularly, it will naturally have a shorter lifespan compared to one that's used occasionally. Heavy usage, such as charging multiple devices simultaneously or using it to power devices for extended periods, can reduce its lifespan.\n4. **Storage conditions**: Extreme temperatures, humidity, and physical damage can affect a power bank's lifespan. Storing it in a cool, dry place and avoiding physical stress can help extend its lifespan.\n5. **Quality of the power bank**: A high-quality power bank with a reputable brand and good build quality can last longer than a cheaper, low-quality option.\n\nTo extend the lifespan of your portable power bank:\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures (below 32°F or above 95°F)\n* Store it in a cool, dry place\n* Avoid physical stress, such as drops or crushing\n* Keep it away from water and moisture\n* Update the power bank's firmware regularly (if possible)\n* Avoid overcharging or undercharging\n* Clean the power bank's contacts and ports regularly\n\nBy following these tips and using your power bank responsibly, you can expect it to last for around 2-3 years with regular use. However, it's essential to monitor its performance and replace it when you notice a significant decline in its capacity or overall performance.",
