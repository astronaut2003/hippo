      "memory": "Write me the beginning of a script (formatted like a real movie script) for a comedy movie scene, based on the below information:\n\nAndy, a man in his 40s, is the Head of Computing at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He has poor personal hygiene and can often be found making moaning noises while using disabled toilets, despite him having no obvious disability. Andy wears an untidy, stained white shirt. When addressing a group he starts with the words \"Right guys, settle down\".\n\nRoger, a man in his 50s, is a computing teacher working under Andy. He is an intelligent man, with grey hair and a laid back attitude to teaching. His classes are often out of control, while he sits there in despair. He has quiet contempt at the fact that Andy is the head of department, because he knows that he is much more qualified than Andy.\n\nJohn is a 69 year old man working as an exam invigilator. As he is past retirement it is unusual that he is still working, but we suspect it might be because he enjoys making people uncomfortable. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his colleagues.\n\nRuth, a woman in her 40s, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to people in German and they don't understand what she's saying. She is attracted to women and regularly has to deter John's advances.",

      "memory": "A cashmere blend cardigan can be a great substitute for a blazer, especially if it's well-fitted and has a more structured silhouette. Here are a few things to consider to make it work:\n\n**Fit:** Make sure the cardigan fits you well and isn't too slouchy or oversized. You want it to skim your body and create a clean line over your blouse.\n\n**Style:** Opt for a cardigan with a more tailored or fitted silhouette, rather than a loose, open-front cardigan. This will help create a more polished, blazer-like look.\n\n**Color:** Choose a neutral color that complements your blouse. If your blouse is bold or brightly colored, a neutral-colored cardigan will help tone it down and create a more professional look. If your blouse is more subdued, you can opt for a cardigan in a slightly bolder color to add some contrast.\n\n**Layering:** Make sure to layer the cardigan over your blouse correctly. You can either wear it open, with the blouse visible underneath, or closed, with the cardigan buttons or zipper done up. Experiment with both options to see what looks best on you.\n\n**Add some structure:** To give your outfit a more polished, blazer-like feel, add some structure with a pair of trousers or a pencil skirt. This will help balance out the softness of the cardigan.\n\nHere's an example of how you could style your outfit:\n\n* Silk blouse in a bold color or pattern\n* Cashmere blend cardigan in a neutral color (e.g., navy, gray, beige)\n* Fitted trousers or pencil skirt in a neutral color (e.g., black, navy, gray)\n* Low to medium-heeled pumps or loafers in a neutral color\n* Simple jewelry, such as a classic watch and a simple necklace or earrings\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a polished, professional look that's perfect for a work event. The cashmere blend cardigan will add a touch of sophistication and elegance to your outfit, while the silk blouse will still be the star of the show!",

      "memory": "I'd be delighted to help! Congratulations on your new silk blouse, and I'm sure it's lovely. Styling a beautiful blouse for a work event can be a great way to make a statement and feel confident. Here are some outfit suggestions to inspire you:\n\n**Classic and Chic**\n\n* Pair the silk blouse with a tailored pencil skirt or a fitted A-line skirt in a neutral color like black, navy, or beige. This creates a timeless, professional look that's perfect for a work event.\n* Add a pair of low to medium-heeled pumps in a neutral color to complete the outfit.\n\n**Modern and Sophisticated**\n\n* Combine the blouse with a pair of well-fitted trousers in a lightweight material like wool or cotton. A neutral color like gray, beige, or navy will provide a sleek backdrop for your blouse.\n* Add a statement piece of jewelry, like a bold necklace or earrings, to add some visual interest to your outfit.\n\n**Blazer and Blouse**\n\n* Layer a tailored blazer over your blouse to add a professional touch. Look for a blazer in a neutral color that complements your blouse.\n* Pair the blazer and blouse with a pair of fitted trousers or a pencil skirt for a polished look.\n\n**Add Some Texture**\n\n* Mix and match different textures to add depth to your outfit. For example, pair the silk blouse with a pair of velvet or suede trousers or a skirt.\n* Add a pair of tights or stockings in a neutral color to add some extra texture and interest.\n\n**Play with Neutrals**\n\n* Use your silk blouse as a statement piece and pair it with neutral-colored pieces like a white or beige pencil skirt or trousers.\n* Add a pop of color with a scarf, belt, or shoes to break up the neutral palette.\n\n**Accessories Make a Difference**\n\n* Choose a simple yet elegant clutch or a small crossbody bag to complement your outfit.\n* Add a pair of elegant earrings or a simple necklace to complete your look.\n\nRemember, the key to styling a beautiful blouse is to balance it with complementary pieces that don't overpower it. Experiment with different combinations to find the one that makes you feel confident and stylish!",
