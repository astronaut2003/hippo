However, I can still help you find some affordable options.\n\nAs you're flying from Tokyo, you have several options for budget airlines. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Peach Aviation**: A Japanese low-cost carrier that operates direct flights from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Seoul Incheon (ICN) with prices starting from around ¥15,000 - ¥25,000 ( approx. $140-$230 USD) for a one-way ticket, depending on the date and time.\n2. **Jetstar Japan**: Another Japanese budget airline that operates direct flights from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Seoul Incheon (ICN) with prices starting from around ¥18,000 - ¥30,000 (approx. $160-$270 USD) for a one-way ticket.\n3. **T'way Air**: A Korean low-cost carrier that operates direct flights from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Seoul Incheon (ICN) with prices starting from around ¥20,000 - ¥35,000 (approx. $180-$310 USD) for a one-way ticket.\n4. **Air Seoul**: A Korean low-cost carrier that operates direct flights from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Seoul Incheon (ICN) with prices starting from around ¥22,000 - ¥40,000 (approx. $200-$360 USD) for a one-way ticket.\n\nKeep in mind that these prices are subject to change and availability, so it's always a good idea to compare prices across multiple airlines and book in advance to secure the best deals.\n\nYou can use flight comparison websites like Skyscanner, Google Flights, or Expedia to search for flights and find the best options for your travel dates.\n\nAdditionally, consider flying into Seoul's Gimpo Airport (GMP) instead of Incheon International Airport (ICN), as it might be a more affordable option. However, keep in mind that Gimpo Airport is located closer to the city center, so you might need to factor in additional transportation costs to get to your accommodation.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on finding affordable flights to Seoul!",
