You can use a gentle dish soap or a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar.\n4. **Scrub the French press**: Use a soft-bristled brush or a non-abrasive scrubber to scrub away any stubborn coffee oils and residue. Focus on the areas around the rim, lid, and plunger.\n5. **Rinse thoroughly**: Rinse the French press thoroughly with hot water to remove any soap or vinegar residue.\n6. **Dry the French press**: Dry the French press with a towel, paying extra attention to the crevices and areas where water may collect.\n7. **Sanitize the French press (optional)**: If you want to sanitize your French press, mix 1 tablespoon of unscented chlorine bleach with 1 quart of water.

      "memory": "Citrus notes are a great addition to coffee! You've got a good starting point with your French press ratio, now let's explore some coffee beans that would complement citrus flavors nicely.\n\nWhen it comes to pairing coffee with citrus, you'll want beans that have bright, vibrant acidity and flavor profiles that won't overpower the citrus notes. Here are some coffee bean options that might fit the bill:\n\n1. **Kenyan coffee**: Kenyan beans are known for their bright acidity and complex flavor profiles, which often feature citrus notes like lemon, orange, and grapefruit. Look for beans from regions like Nyeri, Kiambu, or Muranga.\n2. **Ethiopian Yirgacheffe**: Ethiopian coffees are renowned for their floral and citrus flavors. Yirgacheffe beans, in particular, offer a delicate, tea-like body with notes of lemon, bergamot, and citrus blossoms.\n3. **Colombian Gesha**: Gesha beans from Colombia often exhibit a citrusy flavor profile, with notes of orange, lemon, and lime. They tend to have a medium to high acidity, which will cut through the richness of the citrus.\n4. **Guatemalan Antigua**: Guatemalan Antigua beans can have a balanced acidity and flavor profiles that feature citrus notes like orange, lemon, and citrus peel. Look for beans from farms in the Antigua region.\n5. **Rwanda Bourbon**: Rwandan Bourbon beans are known for their bright acidity and flavors of citrus, berries, and stone fruits. They can add a nice balance to citrus notes in your coffee recipe.\n\nWhen experimenting with citrus-infused coffee, consider the type of citrus fruit you're using and how you're incorporating it. Are you adding juice, zest, or slices to your coffee? This will help you determine the best coffee bean to pair with it.\n\nFor your French press, you might want to adjust the grind size and steeping time to bring out the optimal flavor from your chosen coffee beans. A medium-coarse grind and a 3-4 minute steeping time could be a good starting point.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different roasts, too. A lighter roast might accentuate the citrus notes, while a darker roast could add a richer, more balanced flavor.\n\nHave fun exploring these options, and I hope you find the perfect coffee-citrus combination!",

This will prevent air, light, and moisture from affecting the beans.\n2. **Cool, dark place**: Keep the container in a cool, dark place, like a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing coffee beans near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight.\n3. **Room temperature**: Store coffee beans at room temperature (around 60-70°F/15-21°C). Avoid storing them in the refrigerator or freezer, as the moisture and temperature fluctuations can affect the beans.\n4. **Use within 2 weeks**: Try to use your coffee beans within 2 weeks of opening the bag or container. This ensures the beans are at their peak flavor and aroma.\n5. **Freeze for longer storage**: If you won't be using the beans within 2 weeks, consider freezing them. Place the beans in an airtight container or freezer bag, making sure to remove as much air as possible before sealing. Frozen coffee beans can be stored for up to 3-6 months.\n6. **Grind just before brewing**: Grind your coffee beans just before brewing to ensure the freshest flavor. Pre-ground coffee can sit on a shelf for weeks or months, losing its flavor and aroma.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to preserve the freshness and flavor of your coffee beans and enjoy a delicious cup every time!\n\nHave fun experimenting with your new beans and citrus notes in your French press!",

The bergamot will complement and enhance the citrus notes in your coffee, creating a lovely harmony.\n2. **Green Tea with Lemon Myrtle**: A light and refreshing green tea paired with the citrusy flavor of lemon myrtle can create a beautiful balance. Lemon myrtle is a native Australian herb that adds a sweet, citrusy flavor without being overpowering.\n3. **White Peony**: This Chinese white tea is known for its delicate, floral flavor profile, which can help to balance out the brightness of citrus. Its subtle sweetness will also complement the acidity in the coffee.\n4. **Genmaicha**: This Japanese green tea blend combines the freshness of green tea with the nutty flavor of roasted brown rice. The subtle citrus notes in the green tea will pair nicely with the citrus flavors in your coffee.\n5. **Lady Grey**: Similar to Earl Grey, Lady Grey tea is flavored with citrus fruits like orange, lemon, and bergamot. However, Lady Grey tends to have a more delicate flavor profile, making it a great option if you prefer a lighter citrus note.\n\nWhen pairing tea with citrus-infused coffee, consider the type of citrus fruit you're using and the strength of the flavor. For example, if you're using a strong citrus like lemon or orange, a more delicate tea like White Peony or Genmaicha might be a better fit. If you're using a more subtle citrus like grapefruit or lime, a stronger tea like Earl Grey or Lady Grey could work well.\n\nRemember, tea and coffee pairing is all about experimentation and personal preference.

Here are some valuable tips to help you stay hydrated during your 20-mile bike ride:\n\n1. **Hydrate before you ride**: Drink 16-20 ounces of water or a sports drink 1-2 hours before your ride to top off your fluid levels. Aim to urinate pale yellow or clear to ensure you're well-hydrated.\n2. **Bring water bottles or a hydration pack**: Attach water bottles to your bike or wear a hydration pack to carry enough fluids for the duration of your ride. Aim for at least 1 water bottle (20-24 oz) per hour of riding.\n3. **Drink regularly**: Take small sips of water every 10-15 minutes to maintain a steady flow of fluids. This is especially important in hot or humid weather.\n4. **Electrolyte-rich drinks**: Consider using sports drinks like Gatorade or Nuun, which contain electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium) to help replace those lost through sweat. These drinks can be especially helpful during long, intense rides or in extreme weather conditions.\n5. **Monitor your urine output**: If you're not urinating frequently enough or your urine is dark yellow, it may be a sign that you're not drinking enough water. Take a quick break to drink some water and reassess your hydration.\n6. **Avoid caffeine and sugary drinks**: While they may provide a temporary energy boost, caffeine and sugary drinks can exacerbate dehydration. Stick to water or sports drinks instead.\n7. **Eat hydrating foods**: Incorporate foods with high water content into your pre-ride meal or snack, such as watermelon, bananas, or energy bars with electrolytes.\n8. **Be aware of weather conditions**: Adjust your hydration plan according to the weather. In hot or humid conditions, you may need to drink more frequently or in larger quantities.\n9. **Take breaks**: Stop every hour or so to stretch, rest, and drink some water. This will help you stay hydrated and reduce the risk of fatigue.\n10. **Post-ride hydration**: After your ride, drink water or a sports drink to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes. This will help your body recover and reduce muscle soreness.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well-prepared to stay hydrated during your 20-mile bike ride and enjoy a safe, comfortable, and successful ride!",
