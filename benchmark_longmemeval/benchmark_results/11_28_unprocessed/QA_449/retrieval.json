      "memory": "CITGO operates three refineries in the United States, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana; Lemont, Illinois; and Corpus Christi, Texas. Each refinery has its own set of refining processes, but here are some of the main processes that go on at each facility:\n\n1. Lake Charles Refinery:\n* Atmospheric distillation: This is the first step in the refining process, where crude oil is heated and separated into different fractions based on their boiling points.\n* Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC): This process breaks down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products such as gasoline and diesel fuel.\n* Alkylation: This process combines smaller molecules to form larger ones, creating high-octane gasoline components.\n* Hydrotreating: This process removes impurities from the gasoline and diesel fractions to improve their quality.\n1. Lemont Refinery:\n* Atmospheric distillation: As with the Lake Charles Refinery, this is the initial step in the refining process.\n* Delayed coking: This process breaks down heavy, residual oils into lighter products such as naphtha, diesel, and petroleum coke.\n* Hydrocracking: This process uses hydrogen and a catalyst to break down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products.\n* Hydrotreating: This process is used to remove sulfur and other impurities from the gasoline and diesel fractions.\n1. Corpus Christi Refinery:\n* Atmospheric distillation: Again, this is the first step in the refining process.\n* Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC): As with the Lake Charles Refinery, this process is used to break down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products.\n* Alkylation: This process combines smaller molecules to form larger ones, creating high-octane gasoline components.\n* Hydrocracking: This process is used to break down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products.\n* Hydrotreating: This process removes impurities from the gasoline and diesel fractions to improve their quality.\n\nIt's worth noting that these are just some of the processes that take place at each refinery, and there may be others as well. Additionally, the specific refining processes used can vary depending on the type of crude oil being processed and the market demand for different petroleum products.",

The citrine stone and silver filigree combination is a classic and elegant choice.\n\nBased on your description, I can make some educated guesses about the brooch's origins:\n\n1. **Era:** The style and construction of the brooch suggest it might be from the early 20th century, possibly from the 1920s to the 1940s. The use of filigree and citrine stone was popular during this period, especially in Art Deco and Art Nouveau designs.\n2. **Materials:** The silver filigree is likely sterling silver (92.5% silver), and the citrine stone is a type of quartz. Citrine was a popular gemstone during the early 20th century, often used in jewelry pieces.\n3. **Craftsmanship:** The intricate filigree work suggests that the brooch was made by a skilled craftsman or in a high-end jewelry workshop. The lack of markings or signatures might indicate that it was made by a smaller, independent jeweler or an individual craftsman.\n4. **Value:** The value of your brooch depends on several factors, including its condition, rarity, and demand. Based on the description, I would estimate the value to be in the range of $200 to $500. However, this is a rough estimate, and a professional appraisal would be necessary for a more accurate valuation.\n\nTo further research your brooch, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Consult online marketplaces:** Look for similar brooches on online marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, or 1stdibs to see if you can find similar pieces and their prices.\n2. **Visit antique jewelry dealers:** Take your brooch to reputable antique jewelry dealers or vintage jewelry shops to get their expert opinion and valuation.\n3. **Consult jewelry historians or appraisers:** Reach out to jewelry historians or professional appraisers who specialize in antique and vintage jewelry. They can provide a more detailed analysis and valuation.\n\nKeep in mind that the value of an item is ultimately determined by what a buyer is willing to pay for it. If you're interested in selling your brooch, consider getting it appraised and listed on online marketplaces or with a reputable dealer.\n\nWhat do you think?

The system has been in operation since the 1980s and treats wastewater from the city of Arcata. The treated water is used to irrigate crops and wetlands, providing habitat for wildlife.\n\n2. Kooragang Island Wetlands, New South Wales, Australia: This wetland system was constructed in the 1990s to treat industrial wastewater from a nearby chemical plant. The wetland system has been successful in reducing the levels of pollutants in the wastewater before it is discharged into a nearby river.\n\n3. Shenyang Botanical Garden, Shenyang, China: This is one of the largest constructed wetland systems in the world and treats wastewater from a nearby city. The system has been successful in removing nutrients and organic matter from the wastewater, and the treated water is used for irrigation and other purposes.\n\n4. Bellevue, Washington, USA: This city has implemented a decentralized system of constructed wetlands for residential and commercial wastewater treatment. The system has been successful in reducing the need for expensive centralized treatment systems and providing a sustainable option for wastewater treatment.\n\nOverall, these examples demonstrate the potential for constructed wetlands as a sustainable and effective option for wastewater treatment, and serve as models for future development and implementation of wetland systems.",
