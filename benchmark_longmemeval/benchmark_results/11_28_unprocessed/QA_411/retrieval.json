      "memory": "To create a snap-to experience for the infinite scroll video feed, you can use CSS Scroll Snap Points. This will ensure that when the user scrolls through the video feed, each video will snap into place, occupying the entire viewport.\n\nFirst, in `Home.svelte`, update the `ul` element to use a CSS class named `video-feed`:\n```html\n<ul id=\"video-list\" class=\"video-feed\">\n  {#each videos as video}\n    <li>\n      <VideoPlayer src=\"{video.url}\" videoId=\"{video.id}\" />\n    </li>\n  {/each}\n</ul>\n```\nNext, add the following CSS styles to `Home.svelte`:\n```css\n.video-feed {\n  list-style-type: none;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100vh;\n  overflow-y: scroll;\n  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\n\n.video-feed li {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  min-height: 100vh;\n  scroll-snap-align: start;\n  scroll-snap-stop: always;\n}\n```\nThese styles achieve the following:\n\n1. `.video-feed`: Defines the video feed as a scroll container with a mandatory snap type along the y-axis. This ensures that the scrolling will snap to specific points along the y-axis (defined by the `scroll-snap-align` property of the child elements). The `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` line provides smooth scrolling for iOS devices.\n2. `.video-feed li`: Defines each list item (video) as a snap point using the `scroll-snap-align: start;` property. The `scroll-snap-stop: always;` property ensures the scrolling will always stop at the snap point, even when the user scrolls quickly.\n\nNow, your infinite scroll video feed in `Home.svelte` will have a snap-to experience, with each video snapping into place and occupying the entire viewport as the user scrolls through the feed.",
