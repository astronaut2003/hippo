You might want to consider stopping in some of the charming coastal towns or cities along the way, like Wilmington, NC, or Charleston, SC, to stretch your legs and grab a bite to eat.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to check the road conditions and traffic updates before you leave to ensure a smooth trip. And don't forget to pack accordingly, with plenty of snacks, water, and entertainment for the road.\n\nOnce you arrive at Tybee Island, you'll be rewarded with beautiful beaches, a laid-back atmosphere, and plenty of opportunities to catch some waves.

Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Beartooth Highway Overview**\n\nThe Beartooth Highway (US-212) is a 68-mile scenic road that connects Cooke City, Montana, to Red Lodge, Montana, passing through the Beartooth Mountains. It's considered one of the most scenic drives in the US, with stunning mountain vistas, alpine lakes, and abundant wildlife.\n\n**Summer Road Conditions**\n\nDuring the summer months (late May to early October), the Beartooth Highway is generally in good condition, with:\n\n1. **Paved road**: The entire highway is paved, making it suitable for most vehicles, including RVs and trailers.\n2. **Wide lanes**: The road has two lanes, with occasional passing lanes and pull-outs for slower traffic.\n3. **Speed limits**: The speed limit is 45-65 mph (72-105 km/h), but be prepared for slower traffic, especially around scenic viewpoints and wildlife areas.\n4. **Weather**: Summer weather is usually mild, with average highs in the 60s-70s°F (15-21°C). However, be prepared for occasional thunderstorms, which can bring heavy rain and strong winds.\n5. **Road maintenance**: The highway is well-maintained, with regular cleaning and maintenance crews ensuring the road is clear of debris and hazards.\n\n**Summer Driving Tips**\n\n1. **Take your time**: The Beartooth Highway is a scenic drive, so enjoy the views, and don't rush. There are many pull-outs and scenic viewpoints where you can stop to take in the scenery.\n2. **Watch for wildlife**: The Beartooth Mountains are home to a variety of wildlife, including bears, elk, deer, and bighorn sheep. Be cautious when driving, especially at dawn and dusk when animals are most active.\n3. **Be prepared for altitude**: The Beartooth Highway reaches elevations over 10,000 feet (3,000 meters), which can cause altitude sickness in some individuals. Take regular breaks, stay hydrated, and be aware of any altitude-related symptoms.\n4. **Fill up on gas**: Gas stations are limited along the highway, so fill up in Cooke City or Red Lodge before embarking on your drive.\n5. **Check road conditions**: Before you start your drive, check the Montana Department of Transportation's website for any road closures or construction updates.\n\n**Additional Tips for Your Grand Teton and Yellowstone Loop**\n\n1. **Plan for crowds**: Summer is peak tourist season in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, so be prepared for crowds and long lines at popular attractions.\n2. **Book accommodations in advance**: Lodges and campgrounds in the parks and surrounding areas fill up quickly, so book your accommodations well in advance.\n3. **Bring bear spray**: Both parks are home to bears, so it's essential to carry bear spray and know how to use it properly.\n4. **Take advantage of park resources**: Both parks offer free shuttle services, guided tours, and ranger programs, which can enhance your experience and reduce congestion.\n\nWith these tips, you'll be well-prepared for an unforgettable drive on the Beartooth Highway and an amazing national park adventure!",
