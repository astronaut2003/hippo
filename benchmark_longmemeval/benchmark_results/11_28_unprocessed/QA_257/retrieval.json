Make sure the compressor is rated for your spring size.\n4. **Mark the original mounting points**: Take note of the original mounting points and orientations to ensure proper alignment during reinstallation.\n5. **Tighten bolts in sequence**: Follow the manufacturer's recommended torque sequence to avoid damaging the coilovers or surrounding components.\n6. **Check for proper fitment**: Verify that the coilovers fit snugly and are properly seated before tightening the bolts.\n7. ** Bleed the system**: If your coilovers have a hydraulic system, bleed the air out to ensure proper damping performance.\n8. **Reinstall in reverse order**: Reinstall the components in the reverse order of how you removed them to avoid complications.\n9. **Test the installation**: Before hitting the road, test the suspension by bouncing the car and checking for any unusual noises or movements.\n10. **Consult a professional if needed**: If you're not comfortable with the installation, consider seeking the help of a professional mechanic or suspension specialist.\n\n**Additional Tips for Your 2018 Honda Civic Si:**\n\n1. **Remove the rear seats and trunk trim**: This will give you better access to the rear suspension components.\n2. **Use a Honda-specific spring compressor**: The Civic Si's springs can be particularly stubborn, so a Honda-specific compressor may be necessary.\n3. **Be mindful of the front strut tower bar**: When reinstalling the front coilovers, ensure the strut tower bar is properly aligned and secured.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well-prepared for a successful coilover installation. Take your time, be patient, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Good luck!",

Calculate the mean of the sample measurements:\nMean = (95+97+101+102+104)/5 = 99.8 grams\n2. Calculate the variance of the sample measurements:\nVariance = [(95-99.8)^2 + (97-99.8)^2 + (101-99.8)^2 + (102-99.8)^2 + (104-99.8)^2]/(5-1)\n= [(-4.8)^2 + (-2.8)^2 + (1.2)^2 + (2.2)^2 + (4.2)^2]/4\n= 14.5 grams^2\n3. Calculate the standard deviation of the sample measurements by taking the square root of the variance:\nStandard deviation = sqrt(14.5) = 3.8 grams\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the measurement for the liquid is 3.8 grams. This means that the actual weight of the liquid is expected to vary from 99.8 grams by approximately plus or minus 3.8 grams.",
