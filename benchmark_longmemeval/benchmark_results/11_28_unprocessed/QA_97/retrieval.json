Fortunately, Tokyo has a comprehensive and efficient public transportation system that's relatively affordable. Here are some affordable transportation options to get you to popular tourist spots like Shibuya Crossing and Tokyo Tower:\n\n**Subway and Train:**\n\n1. **Suica or Pasmo cards:** Buy a prepaid IC card (like Suica or Pasmo) at most train stations. These cards can be refilled and used to ride subways, trains, and buses. A single ride typically costs ¥200-¥400 (around $2-$4 USD).\n2. **Tokyo Metro:** The Tokyo Metro is an efficient way to get around the city. A single ride costs ¥200-¥400 (around $2-$4 USD), but you can also buy a 24-hour pass for ¥600 (around $6 USD).\n3. **JR Train:** Japan Railways (JR) operates trains that connect major stations. A single ride costs ¥130-¥240 (around $1.30-$2.40 USD).\n\n**Bus:**\n\n1. **Toei Bus:** Toei Bus is a affordable option for shorter distances. A single ride costs ¥210 (around $2 USD).\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **Walking:** Tokyo is a walkable city, and walking is a great way to explore neighborhoods. Just be mindful of pedestrian rules and traffic signs.\n2. **Bicycle:** Some areas, like Shibuya, offer bike-sharing services. This can be a fun and affordable way to get around.\n\n**Getting to Popular Tourist Spots:**\n\n1. **Shibuya Crossing:** Take the JR Yamanote Line to Shibuya Station (¥130, around $1.30 USD). From there, follow the signs to Shibuya Crossing.\n2. **Tokyo Tower:** Take the JR Sobu Line to Hamamatsucho Station (¥130, around $1.30 USD). From there, take a 10-minute walk to Tokyo Tower.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* **Peak hours:** Avoid traveling during rush hour (7:30-9:30 am and 5:00-7:00 pm) when trains and subways are extremely crowded.\n* **Station maps:** Familiarize yourself with station maps and signs, as they can be complex.\n* **English support:** Many stations have English-speaking staff or signs, but it's still a good idea to learn basic Japanese phrases like \"\" (eki) for \"station\" and \"\" (migi) for \"right.\"\n\n**Budget-Friendly Tips:**\n\n* **Buy a prepaid IC card:** It's more convenient and cost-effective than buying individual tickets.\n* **Use the subway or train:** These are generally cheaper than buses or taxis.\n* **Walk or bike:** When possible, walking or biking can be a great way to save money and experience the city.\n\nWith these options, you can easily navigate Tokyo without breaking the bank. Enjoy your trip!",
