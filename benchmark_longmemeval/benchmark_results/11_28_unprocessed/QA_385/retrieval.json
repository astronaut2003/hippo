Manage workload and meet deadlines without burning out\n2. Set healthy boundaries with colleagues and friends\n\nNow, let's create a rough outline of your weekly schedule. We can adjust as needed.\n\n**Sample Schedule:**\n\nMonday:\n\n* 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM: Work\n* 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Yoga class (if scheduled on Monday)\n* 7:30 PM - 8:30 PM: Meditation and journaling\n\nTuesday:\n\n* 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM: Work\n* 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Free time (relaxation, reading, or other activities)\n\nWednesday:\n\n* 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM: Work\n* 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Meditation and journaling\n\nThursday:\n\n* 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM: Work\n* 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM: Bi-weekly dinner with friends (if scheduled on Thursday)\n\nFriday:\n\n* 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM: Work\n* 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Free time (relaxation, reading, or other activities)\n\nWeekends:\n\n* Set aside time for self-care, relaxation, and personal activities\n\n**Boundary-Setting Strategies:**\n\n1. **Learn to say no**: When a colleague or friend asks for a favor, take a moment to assess your workload and priorities.

Establish clear expectations and deadlines to avoid overcommitting.\n3. **Schedule self-care**: Treat self-care activities as non-negotiable appointments. Make time for meditation, journaling, and other activities that nourish your mind and body.\n4. **Be intentional with social commitments**: Review your social commitments and prioritize those that bring you joy and fulfillment. Be honest with yourself and others about your availability and capacity.\n\nHow does this rough outline look to you? Are there any changes or adjustments you'd like to make?",
