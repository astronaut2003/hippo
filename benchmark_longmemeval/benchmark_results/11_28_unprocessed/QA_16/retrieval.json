Considering you spent around the same amount on the customized phone case for his birthday, it's a thoughtful and consistent gesture. $25 is a decent amount that can get your brother a new game, some in-game items, or a few months of subscription to a gaming service.\n\nWith a $25 gift card, your brother can:\n\n* Purchase a new game or DLC (downloadable content) for his favorite game\n* Buy in-game items, such as skins, characters, or currency\n* Subscribe to a gaming service like Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Now, or NVIDIA GeForce NOW for a few months\n* Get a few months of online gaming subscription, such as Xbox Live Gold or PlayStation Plus\n\nA $25 gift card is a generous amount that shows you care about your brother's gaming habits and want to support his gaming experiences. It's also a flexible gift that allows him to choose something he really wants or needs.\n\nI think pairing the gaming-themed mousepad with a $25 gift card to his favorite gaming platform's store is an excellent gift idea.
