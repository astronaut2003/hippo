On December 5, a team at LLNL’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) conducted the first controlled fusion experiment in history to reach this milestone, also known as scientific energy breakeven, meaning it produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it. This historic, first-of-its kind achievement will provide unprecedented capability to support NNSA’s Stockpile Stewardship Program and will provide invaluable insights into the prospects of clean fusion energy, which would be a game-changer for efforts to achieve President Biden’s goal of a net-zero carbon economy.\n\n“This is a landmark achievement for the researchers and staff at the National Ignition Facility who have dedicated their careers to seeing fusion ignition become a reality, and this milestone will undoubtedly spark even more discovery,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting our world-class scientists—like the team at NIF—whose work will help us solve humanity’s most complex and pressing problems, like providing clean power to combat climate change and maintaining a nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.”\n\n“We have had a theoretical understanding of fusion for over a century, but the journey from knowing to doing can be long and arduous. Today’s milestone shows what we can do with perseverance,” said Dr. Arati Prabhakar, the President’s Chief Advisor for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\n“Monday, December 5, 2022, was a historic day in science thanks to the incredible people at Livermore Lab and the National Ignition Facility. In making this breakthrough, they have opened a new chapter in NNSA’s Stockpile Stewardship Program,” said NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby. “I would like to thank the members of Congress who have supported the National Ignition Facility because their belief in the promise of visionary science has been critical for our mission. Our team from around the DOE national laboratories and our international partners have shown us the power of collaboration.”\n\n“The pursuit of fusion ignition in the laboratory is one of the most significant scientific challenges ever tackled by humanity, and achieving it is a triumph of science, engineering, and most of all, people,” LLNL Director Dr. Kim Budil said. “Crossing this threshold is the vision that has driven 60 years of dedicated pursuit—a continual process of learning, building, expanding knowledge and capability, and then finding ways to overcome the new challenges that emerged. These are the problems that the U.S. national laboratories were created to solve.”",

      "memory": "There have been several notable success stories in recent years demonstrating the effectiveness of non-traditional approaches to diplomacy. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Cultural and educational exchanges: Cultural and educational exchanges have long been used as a tool for diplomacy, and they have proven to be quite effective. The Fulbright Program, for instance, has been credited with fostering mutual understanding between nations and building lasting relationships between people of different cultures.\n\n2. Science diplomacy: Science diplomacy has played a key role in facilitating international cooperation on a range of issues, including climate change, nuclear proliferation, and space exploration. For example, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, which aims to develop a sustainable source of energy through nuclear fusion, involves the collaboration of 35 countries and is seen as a model of successful science diplomacy.\n\n3. Humanitarian diplomacy: Diplomatic efforts to address humanitarian crises have also yielded positive results. For instance, in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a global effort was launched that involved the participation of governments, NGOs, and private sector organizations. Together, these actors were able to contain the outbreak and prevent it from becoming a global pandemic.\n\n4. Digital diplomacy: Social media has become an increasingly important tool for diplomacy, and it has been used to good effect in promoting public diplomacy initiatives and promoting cross-cultural understanding. For example, the U.S. State Department's Twitter account in Arabic has been credited with helping to improve relations between the U.S. and Arab States.\n\nWhile non-traditional approaches to diplomacy are still relatively new, the above examples demonstrate that they can be effective in building relationships and addressing global challenges.",
