Here are some highly recommended books that focus on the effects of climate change on coastal cities:\n\n1. **\"Rising: Dispatches from the New American Shore\" by Elizabeth Rush**: This book is a beautifully written and deeply reported exploration of the impact of sea level rise on coastal communities across the United States. Rush travels to vulnerable areas, from the Outer Banks to Miami, to document the lives of people living on the front lines of climate change.\n2. **\"The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World\" by Jeff Goodell**: This book is a compelling and accessible exploration of the impact of sea level rise on coastal cities around the world. Goodell visits cities like Miami, Rotterdam, and Venice to document the effects of rising waters and the efforts to adapt to this new reality.\n3. **\"Sea Level Rise: A Politics of the Ocean\" by John Brock**: This book takes a more academic approach, examining the political and social implications of sea level rise on coastal cities. Brock argues that the response to sea level rise will require a fundamental transformation of our relationship with the ocean and the way we govern coastal areas.\n4. **\"Tideland: The Rising Tide of Global Risk and the Future of Our Coastal Cities\" by Cynthia Barnett**: This book explores the intersection of sea level rise, coastal development, and urbanization, highlighting the risks and consequences of our growing coastal populations. Barnett argues that we need to rethink our approach to coastal development and prioritize resilience and adaptation.\n5. **\"High Tide on Main Street: Rising Sea Level and the Coming Coastal Crisis\" by John Englander**: This book provides a comprehensive overview of the impacts of sea level rise on coastal cities, including flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Englander, a leading expert on sea level rise, argues that we need to take immediate action to prepare for the coming coastal crisis.\n\nThese books offer a range of perspectives and approaches to understanding the impact of climate change on coastal cities. They're all highly readable and well-researched, making them great resources for anyone looking to dive deeper into this critical topic.",

      "memory": "Wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the \"American Cancer Society's Making Strides Against Breast Cancer\" event!\n\n**History of the Event:**\nMaking Strides Against Breast Cancer was founded in 1988 in Boston, Massachusetts, by a group of passionate volunteers who wanted to make a difference in the fight against breast cancer. The first event had 200 participants and raised $30,000. Today, Making Strides has grown into a national event, with over 1 million participants in more than 200 locations across the United States.\n\n**The Event:**\nMaking Strides Against Breast Cancer is a 5K walk/run event that takes place in July and August, with some locations hosting events in October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The event is open to people of all ages and fitness levels, and participants can walk, run, or volunteer to support the cause.\n\n**Funds Raised and How They're Used:**\nThe funds raised through Making Strides Against Breast Cancer support the American Cancer Society's (ACS) breast cancer research, patient services, and education initiatives. The ACS is dedicated to eliminating breast cancer as a life-threatening disease, and the funds raised through Making Strides help make the following possible:\n\n1. **Research:** The ACS invests in cutting-edge research to better understand breast cancer, develop new treatments, and improve patient outcomes.\n2. **Patient Services:** The ACS provides free resources and support to breast cancer patients, including transportation to treatment, lodging, and emotional support.\n3. **Education:** The ACS educates people about breast cancer risk reduction, early detection, and treatment options, as well as promotes awareness about the importance of screenings and early detection.\n\n**Impact:**\nSince its inception, Making Strides Against Breast Cancer has raised over $875 million to support the fight against breast cancer. Thanks to events like Making Strides, the ACS has contributed to a 39% decline in breast cancer deaths in the US since 1990.\n\n**Getting Involved:**\nIf you're interested in participating in a Making Strides Against Breast Cancer event, you can:\n\n1. **Register:** Find an event near you and register online.\n2. **Form a Team:** Gather friends, family, or colleagues to form a team and raise funds together.\n3. **Fundraise:** Set a fundraising goal and spread the word about your participation to raise funds.\n4. **Volunteer:** Help with event logistics, registration, or other tasks to support the event.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the \"Walk for Hunger\" 5K walk in February! Making Strides Against Breast Cancer is another fantastic opportunity to make a difference in your community while promoting health and wellness.\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like to learn more about other charity events, feel free to ask!",
