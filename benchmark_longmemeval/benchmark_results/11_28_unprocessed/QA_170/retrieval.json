If you'll be hiking or engaging in outdoor activities, pack clothing that's suitable for those activities (e.g., moisture-wicking tops, comfortable pants). If you'll be attending nicer dinners or events, pack a dressier top or a pair of nicer pants.\n2. **Weather:** Check the weather forecast for your destination and pack accordingly. If it'll be hot and sunny, pack lightweight, breathable tops and bottoms. If it'll be cooler or rainy, pack warmer or water-resistant items.\n3. **Versatility:** Choose items that can be easily mixed-and-matched to create multiple outfits. For example, a neutral-colored top can be paired with both of your bottoms, while a bold-patterned top might be better paired with one specific bottom.\n4. **Personal style:** Pack items that make you feel confident and comfortable. If you have a favorite top or bottom that always makes you feel great, consider packing it, even if it's not the most practical choice.\n5. **Neutrality:** Consider packing neutral-colored items that can be easily dressed up or down. These will give you more flexibility when creating outfits.\n\nHere's an example of how you could apply these factors:\n\n* Top 1: A lightweight, breathable white or gray top that's suitable for outdoor activities and can be dressed up or down.\n* Top 2: A slightly dressier top in a bold color or pattern that can be paired with one of your bottoms for a nicer dinner or event.\n* Top 3: A versatile, neutral-colored top that can be paired with either of your bottoms and works for both casual and slightly dressier occasions.\n* Bottom 1: A comfortable pair of pants or shorts that are suitable for outdoor activities and can be dressed up or down.\n* Bottom 2: A nicer pair of pants or a skirt that can be paired with your dressier top for a special occasion.\n\nRemember, the key is to pack items that can be mixed-and-matched to create multiple outfits, while also considering the activities, weather, and your personal style.",

Pack these items first, and then consider adding a few nice-to-haves, like face wash or moisturizer.\n3. **Multi-tasking products:** Look for products that serve multiple purposes, like a shampoo-conditioner combo or a face moisturizer with SPF.\n4. **Sample sizes:** Consider packing sample-sized toiletries or travel-sized versions of your favorite products. These are often available at pharmacies, beauty supply stores, or online.\n5. **Pack a toiletry bag:** Use a toiletry bag or pouch to keep all your toiletries organized and easy to find. Look for one with multiple compartments and pockets to keep items separated and protected.\n\nHere's a suggested list of toiletries to pack:\n\n* Toothbrush, toothpaste, and dental floss\n* Deodorant and anti-perspirant\n* Prescription medications and any necessary documentation\n* Contact lenses and solution (if applicable)\n* Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash (or a combo product)\n* Razor and shaving cream (if applicable)\n* Makeup and makeup remover (if applicable)\n* Hairbrush or comb\n* Travel-sized essentials like face wash, moisturizer, and lotion\n\nRemember, you can always purchase any necessary toiletries when you arrive at your destination if you forget something or run out.\n\nBy packing smart and prioritizing the essentials, you'll be able to fit everything into a small toiletry bag and avoid overpacking.",
