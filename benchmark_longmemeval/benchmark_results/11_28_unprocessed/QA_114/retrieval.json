It's great that you got to ride it three times in a row and enjoyed every minute of it!\n\nBy the way, did you know that the Revenge of the Mummy rollercoaster features a launch system that accelerates from 0 to 40 mph in just 2 seconds?

HHN is a separately ticketed event that takes place on select nights in September and October, and it's designed for a more mature audience (16+ recommended).\n\nHHN is a highly immersive and terrifying experience that transforms the Universal Studios Hollywood park into a horror fan's playground. The event features:\n\n1. **Mazes**: Highly themed and detailed walk-through attractions based on popular horror franchises, original concepts, and terrifying myths. These mazes are designed to scare and disorient you, with state-of-the-art special effects, atmospheric sound design, and live scareactors.\n2. **Scare Zones**: Designated areas throughout the park where scareactors roam free, creating an unsettling atmosphere and jump scares.\n3. **Live Shows**: Special events and performances, such as the Terror Tram, which takes you on a terrifying journey through the Universal backlot.\n\nSome of the highlights of this year's event include mazes based on popular franchises like The Walking Dead, Stranger Things, and Ghostbusters, as well as original concepts like \"The Curse of Pandora's Box\" and \"Creepshow.\"\n\nIf you're planning to meet up with your friends at HHN, be prepared for:\n\n* Large crowds and long lines, especially on weekends and near the event's closing dates\n* A more intense, horror-focused atmosphere, with plenty of jump scares and terrifying moments\n* A separately ticketed event, which means you'll need to purchase a ticket specifically for HHN (note that regular Universal Studios Hollywood admission does not grant access to HHN)\n\nIf you're a horror fan or enjoy a good scare, HHN is an excellent event to experience. Just be sure to plan ahead, arrive early, and be prepared for a thrilling and terrifying night!\n\nWill you be attending HHN with your friends, or just meeting up with them after the event?",

I'm happy to help you with information on Disneyland's Halloween events.\n\nEvery year, Disneyland Resort in California celebrates Halloween Time, which typically runs from mid-September to November 1st. During this time, the park is transformed with spooky decorations, themed attractions, and special events.\n\nMickey's Halloween Party is a separate-ticket event that takes place on select nights, usually from mid-September to October 31st. The party offers exclusive experiences, such as:\n\n1. Trick-or-treating at designated locations throughout the park.\n2. Special Halloween-themed fireworks and projections on the castle.\n3. Character meet-and-greets in costume.\n4. Exclusive entertainment, like the \"Frightfully Fun Parade\" and \"Mickey's Trick & Treat\" stage show.\n5. Access to Haunted Mansion Holiday and Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy, which are transformed with Halloween-themed overlays.\n\nAs for this year's events, Disneyland has not officially announced the dates and details for Mickey's Halloween Party. However, based on previous years, it's likely that the party will return in mid-September and run through October.\n\nKeep an eye on the official Disneyland website and social media channels for updates on Halloween Time and Mickey's Halloween Party. They usually announce the dates and ticket information in late summer.\n\nIn the meantime, you can start planning your trip by checking the Disneyland website for general park hours, attraction closures, and special events. You might also consider booking your hotel and making dining reservations in advance, as Halloween Time is a popular season at the Disneyland Resort.\n\nHave a spook-tacular time at Disneyland, and I hope you get to experience Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy again!",

      "memory": "Weekdays can be a great time to visit Mickey's Halloween Party, as crowds are generally smaller compared to weekends. Since the party is a separate-ticket event, it tends to attract a dedicated crowd, but weekdays usually have fewer attendees than weekends.\n\nHere are some factors to consider when planning your weekday visit:\n\n1. **Smaller crowds**: As mentioned, weekdays tend to have smaller crowds compared to weekends. This can make it easier to navigate the park, wait times for attractions, and character meet-and-greets.\n2. **Shorter lines**: With fewer guests, you can expect shorter lines for popular attractions like Haunted Mansion Holiday and Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy. You might even be able to fit in more trick-or-treating stops or enjoy the entertainment offerings without long waits.\n3. **More character interactions**: With a smaller crowd, you might have a better chance to interact with your favorite Disney characters, including those in Halloween costumes.\n4. **Parking and arrival**: Weekdays often have easier parking and arrival experiences, as there are fewer cars and guests arriving at the same time.\n5. **Atmosphere**: Some guests feel that the weekday parties have a more intimate and relaxed atmosphere, which can enhance the overall experience.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that:\n\n1. **Some schools have fall breaks**: In California, some schools have fall breaks during the week, which might attract more families to the park. Check the local school schedules to plan accordingly.\n2. **Local events and holidays**: If there are local events or holidays during the week, it might impact park attendance. For example, Halloween falls on a Tuesday this year, so the Monday party might be more crowded than usual.\n\nTo make the most of your weekday visit, consider:\n\n1. **Arriving early**: Take advantage of early access to the park (if available) or arrive at the party start time to beat the crowds.\n2. **Prioritize popular attractions**: Head to Haunted Mansion Holiday and Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy first, as they tend to get busier as the night progresses.\n3. **Plan your trick-or-treating route**: Make a plan for which trick-or-treat stations to visit and when to avoid long lines.\n4. **Enjoy the entertainment**: Take time to enjoy the exclusive party entertainment, such as the \"Frightfully Fun Parade\" and \"Mickey's Trick & Treat\" stage show.\n\nOverall, visiting Mickey's Halloween Party on a weekday can be a great way to experience the event with smaller crowds. Just be prepared for some variability depending on local events and school schedules.",

The theming and attention to detail are supposed to be top-notch, and the scareactors are reportedly doing an amazing job of bringing the Upside Down to life.\n\nAnd yes, the \"Walking Dead\" scare zone is notorious for being one of the most intense areas of the event. The walkers are always a highlight of HHN, and this year's iteration is supposed to be particularly terrifying. Be prepared for a horde of walkers to swarm you as you make your way through the scare zone!\n\nMake sure to plan your night strategically, though. With the crowds and long lines, it's essential to prioritize the mazes and attractions you want to experience the most. Consider using the Universal Studios Hollywood app to reserve a virtual spot in line for some of the more popular mazes, and take advantage of the event's crowd calendar to hit up some of the less busy areas during peak hours.\n\nAlso, don't forget to take breaks and recharge throughout the night. HHN can be overwhelming, especially with the intense scares and crowds. Grab some food, catch a show, or take a breather in the designated \"safe zones\" to regroup and refuel for the rest of the night.\n\nHave an amazing time at HHN with your friends, and I hope you all survive the night!",
