Google Photos offers unlimited original-quality storage for photos up to 16MP and videos up to 1080p, but if you have higher-resolution files or a massive library, you might need additional storage.\n2. **What types of files do you store?** If you have a lot of large files, such as videos, 4K footage, or high-resolution images, you might need more storage.\n3. **Do you plan to store files for others?** If you're sharing storage with family members or colleagues, you might need more space.\n4. **How often do you clean up your files?** If you regularly delete or organize your files, you might not need as much storage.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could start with the 100GB plan and upgrade later if needed. Google Drive offers a flexible pricing plan, so you can always increase your storage capacity as your needs grow.\n\nRemember, the 100GB plan is a great starting point, and you can always upgrade to 200GB or higher if you find you need more space.",
