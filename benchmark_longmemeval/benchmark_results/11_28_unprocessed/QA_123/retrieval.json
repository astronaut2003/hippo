      "memory": "To incorporate the mortgage eligibility and loan term calculation feature in a HTML, JavaScript, or React app, you can write the code in JavaScript and use HTML and React components to display the results.\n\nHere's an example of how you can add this feature to a React app:\n\n1. Create a React component that takes in the user's inputs and calculates the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and loan term. This component can also display the results and error messages.\n\nHere's an example code snippet in React:\n```scss\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction MortgageCalculator() {\n  const [monthlyIncome, setMonthlyIncome] = useState(0);\n  const [monthlyDebt, setMonthlyDebt] = useState(0);\n  const [maxDtiRatio, setMaxDtiRatio] = useState(0.43);\n  const [loanAmount, setLoanAmount] = useState(0);\n  const [interestRate, setInterestRate] = useState(0);\n  const [monthlyPayment, setMonthlyPayment] = useState(0);\n  const [dtiRatio, setDtiRatio] = useState(0);\n  const [loanTerm, setLoanTerm] = useState(0);\n  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');\n\n  const calculateDtiRatio = () => {\n    const dti = monthlyDebt / monthlyIncome;\n    setDtiRatio(dti);\n    if (dti > maxDtiRatio) {\n      setErrorMessage('You are not eligible for a mortgage loan.');\n    } else {\n      setErrorMessage('');\n    }\n  };\n\n  const calculateLoanTerm = () => {\n    const r = interestRate / 12;\n    const n = Math.log(monthlyPayment / (monthlyPayment - r * loanAmount)) / Math.log(1 + r);\n    const term = n / 12;\n    setLoanTerm(term);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Mortgage Calculator</h1>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"monthlyIncome\">Monthly Income:</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"number\"\n          id=\"monthlyIncome\"\n          value={monthlyIncome}\n          onChange={(e) => setMonthlyIncome(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"monthlyDebt\">Monthly Debt:</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"number\"\n          id=\"monthlyDebt\"\n          value={monthlyDebt}\n          onChange={(e) => setMonthlyDebt(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"maxDtiRatio\">Max DTI Ratio:</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"number\"\n          id=\"maxDtiRatio\"\n          value={maxDtiRatio}\n          onChange={(e) => setMaxDtiRatio(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"loanAmount\">Loan\n```",

      "memory": "A Bruin alum! UCLA has an excellent CS program, and it's great that you're considering staying in the UC system. Now, let's dive into the differences between the CS programs at UCLA and UC Berkeley:\n\n**Research Focus:**\n\n* UC Berkeley: Berkeley's CS program is known for its strong research focus on theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. They have a large faculty and a wide range of research areas, which provides students with many opportunities to explore different topics.\n* UCLA: UCLA's CS program also has a strong research focus, but it's more diverse, with research areas including artificial intelligence, data science, computer networks, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. UCLA has a smaller faculty compared to Berkeley, but they're still well-known for their research in these areas.\n\n**Curriculum:**\n\n* UC Berkeley: Berkeley's CS program is known for its rigorous and theoretical coursework. They have a strong emphasis on mathematical foundations, and their courses often have a more theoretical bent. They also offer a wide range of electives, allowing students to specialize in their area of interest.\n* UCLA: UCLA's CS program has a more balanced curriculum, with a mix of theoretical and practical courses. They offer a wide range of electives as well, but their courses might be more applied and industry-focused compared to Berkeley's.\n\n**Admission and Selectivity:**\n\n* UC Berkeley: Berkeley's CS program is extremely competitive, with a low acceptance rate (around 10-15% for MS applicants). They receive a large number of applications, and admission is highly selective.\n* UCLA: UCLA's CS program is also competitive, but slightly less so than Berkeley's. Their acceptance rate is around 20-25% for MS applicants.\n\n**Location and Industry Connections:**\n\n* UC Berkeley: Berkeley is located in the heart of the Bay Area, which provides unparalleled access to tech companies, startups, and research opportunities. Many companies, including Google, Apple, and Facebook, are within a short drive or BART ride from campus.\n* UCLA: UCLA is located in Los Angeles, which has a growing tech industry, but it's not as concentrated as the Bay Area. However, Los Angeles has its own unique advantages, such as proximity to the entertainment industry, and a growing startup scene.\n\n**Culture and Community:**\n\n* UC Berkeley: Berkeley's CS program has a strong, close-knit community, with many student organizations and research groups. The campus has a more laid-back, intellectual vibe, and students often engage in lively debates and discussions.\n* UCLA: UCLA's CS program also has a strong community, with many student organizations and research groups. The campus has a more diverse student body, and the CS department is known for its collaborative and supportive atmosphere.\n\nUltimately, the choice between UCLA and UC Berkeley depends on your individual preferences and goals. If you're looking for a more theoretical, research-focused program with a strong emphasis on mathematical foundations, Berkeley might be the better fit. If you prefer a more balanced curriculum with a mix of theoretical and practical courses, and a strong connection to the Los Angeles tech industry, UCLA could be the way to go.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these differences or any other aspects of the programs?",

I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nCalifornia is home to many top-ranked Computer Science programs, and I'd be more than happy to provide you with some information. Since you're from Arcadia, I'll make sure to highlight some programs that are relatively close to home. Here are some of the top CS programs in California:\n\n1. **Stanford University** (Stanford, CA): Stanford is widely considered one of the best CS programs in the world. It's located in the heart of Silicon Valley, providing access to numerous tech companies and opportunities.\n2. **University of California, Berkeley** (Berkeley, CA): UC Berkeley has a strong CS program with a wide range of research areas, including AI, data science, and computer networks. It's about an hour and a half drive from Arcadia.\n3. **California Institute of Technology (Caltech)** (Pasadena, CA): Caltech is a small, highly selective institution with a strong CS program that focuses on theoretical computer science and machine learning. It's about 20 minutes from Arcadia.\n4. **University of Southern California (USC)** (Los Angeles, CA): USC has a strong CS program with research areas in AI, data science, and computer networks. It's about 30 minutes from Arcadia.\n5. **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** (Los Angeles, CA): UCLA has a large and diverse CS program with research areas in AI, computer networks, and human-computer interaction. It's about 45 minutes from Arcadia.\n6. **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)** (La Jolla, CA): UCSD has a strong CS program with research areas in AI, data science, and computer networks. It's about a 2-hour drive from Arcadia.\n7. **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) - Silicon Valley** (Mountain View, CA): CMU has a satellite campus in Silicon Valley, offering a Master's in CS with a focus on software engineering and data science.\n\nThese are just a few of the top CS programs in California, and there are many other excellent options to consider as well. I recommend researching each program thoroughly to find the best fit for your interests, goals, and location preferences.\n\nAs a side note, it's great to see that you're considering pursuing a Master's degree in CS! With a strong program and location, you'll have many opportunities to advance your career in the tech industry.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these programs or the application process?",
