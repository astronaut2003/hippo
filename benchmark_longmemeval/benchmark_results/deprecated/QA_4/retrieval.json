You can browse through tags, genres, and labels to find hidden gems. They also offer a \"Discover\" feature that suggests music based on your listening history.\n2. **Apple Music**: Apple Music has a vast collection of ambient and lo-fi music, and their \"Browse\" tab features a \"Moods\" section that's perfect for discovering relaxing music. They also have a \"New Music Mix\" playlist that updates regularly, showcasing new artists and tracks.\n3. **Tidal**: Tidal's \"Discover\" feature is powered by human curators, which means you'll get recommendations based on your listening habits and preferences. They also have a \"Rising\" section that highlights emerging artists.\n4. **Deezer**: Deezer's \"Discover\" feature uses AI to recommend music based on your listening history, and they have a \"Mood\" section that's perfect for finding relaxing music.\n\nAs for your Summer Vibes playlist, it sounds like you've got a great mix of chill tracks! If you're looking for more music to add, you might enjoy the following playlists on Spotify:\n\n1. **Lo-Fi Girl**: A popular playlist with over 2 million followers, featuring a constant stream of lo-fi hip-hop and chillhop tracks.\n2. **Ambient Universe**: A playlist with a focus on ambient, drone, and experimental music.\n3. **Chillhop Music**: A playlist featuring a mix of lo-fi hip-hop, chillhop, and instrumental tracks.\n4. **Coffee Shop Jazz**: A playlist with a relaxing atmosphere, perfect for working or studying.\n\nYou can also try exploring Spotify's \"Discover Weekly\" and \"Release Radar\" playlists, which are tailored to your listening habits and preferences.\n\nLastly, if you're interested in discovering new music and artists, I'd recommend checking out online music communities like Reddit's \"WeAreTheMusicMakers\" and \"Music\" subreddits, as well as online forums dedicated to ambient and lo-fi music.

      "memory": "Yes, you are correct. The bonus retries resource should include a reference to the game or games that the bonus retries were used in. This allows you to track which games were played using bonus retries and which were played using regular credits.\n\nHere is an updated snippet for the bonus retries resource that includes a reference to the game:\n```javascript\n{\n  \"fields\": {\n    \"player_id\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"required\": true},\n    \"num_retries\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"earned_by_referral\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"earned_by_purchase\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"used_in_game\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"default\": false},\n    \"used_date\": {\"type\": \"datetime\"},\n    \"game_id\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"reference\": \"games.id\"}\n  }\n}\n```\nThis new field, `game_id`, is a reference to the game resource and allows you to associate the bonus retries with a specific game. When a player uses bonus retries to play a game, you can update the `used_in_game` field to `true` and set the `game_id` to the ID of the game that was played using the bonus retries. This way, you can keep track of which games were played using bonus retries and which were played using regular credits.",
